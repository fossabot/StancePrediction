The well known servant of the Clintons, and one of the front men of their corrupt government, James Comey spent a night in January, 2014 in Rio de Janeiro. Marcus “Skip” Tetheluda is a LLOD reporter who was in touch with one of the Comey’s aides who confirmed that Comes spent a night in a room in Rio De Janeiro with a male prostitute and that all this was funded by the Clintons. To back up this claim, the aide said that there was not only a paper trail but visual evidence as well.
Tetheluda stated:
“This is really f*cked up for Comey. The truth is that besides God and his wife, nobody actually cares about his intimate life and who with he shares his bed, but here we have the fact that a woman who was at that time a candidate for President funded a sex scandal. A sex scandal that involved the head of the FBI, people!! The sources tell us that Comey was on the plane with Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton.
As you can see, there are a number of reasons why fake Russia “evidence has appeared. The only purpose of the liberals is to hide the truth from the people. They represent themselves as caring, good-heart people, but the only truth here is that they are selfish and they only want to earn their vote. The truth is finally exposed and we can clearly see the mess in which they are!",hillary
http://divorcexpo.com/,Rap Sheet: The Women Who Claim to Be Victims of Bill and Hillary Clinton,"While Bill Cosby is finally doing a long overdue perp walk for an alleged sexual assault some 10 years ago, and I say “long overdue” because dozens of woman claim he did the same to them over the decades, the dozen or so women who claim to be victims of Bill and Hillary Clinton are being victimized once again by a DC Media circling the wagons to protect Hillary, a woman they are desperate to see become president.
—
The DC Media is not just politically motivated. Race also plays a factor. The DC Media see black conservatives as apostates who must be destroyed for daring to escape the Left-Wing Thought Plantation. On top of Bill Cosby, and over far, far lesser allegations, this same media has attempted to destroy two powerful black men: Justice Clarence Thomas and Herman Cain.
Despite a laundry list of extremely disturbing allegations involving everything from rape to groping to harassment to character assassination, the DC Media has not only protected white Democrat Bill Clinton, in a number of cases, the media has joined the campaign to destroy these women.
The double standard is glaring.
The pattern is horrifying.
And according to more than one of these alleged victims, Hillary Clinton is Bill’s enabler and the chief protector of their abuser:
The Clintons’ “systematically abuse women and others – sexually, physically, and psychologically – in their scramble for power and wealth,” says [“The Clintons’ War On Women”] press release.
Hillary Clinton’s core agenda is a quest for power, even while she presents herself as champion of women’s issues, [Roger]Stone says.
“If Hillary intends to build her campaign around an appeal to women, her campaign is built on quicksand,” said Stone. But “Hillary is a life-time abuser of women and her advocacy on women issues rings hollow,” he said.
Nevertheless, Bill Clinton is the man the DC Media wants as America’s very first First Gentleman, and other than Donald Trump, no one in the Republican Party has the stomach to make this the issue it deserves to be.
Kathleen Willey … made a splash in 1998 by claiming in a ’60 Minutes’ interview that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her during a Oval Office meeting in 1993.
Now she says Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, has a history of trying to silence the multiple women her husband has slept with, sexually assaulted or sexually harassed since his 1980s Arkansas days.
Self-proclaimed rock-and-roll groupie, who said Mr. Clinton propositioned her in 1984 while she was sunbathing by a Little Rock hotel pool.
Gubernatorial campaign volunteer who said Mr. Clinton raped her during a nursing-home-operators convention in Little Rock in April 1978.
English woman who said Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near Oxford University where Mr. Clinton was a student in 1969.
Former Washington, D.C., political fund-raiser who said Mr. Clinton invited her to his hotel room during a 1991 campaign trip, pinned her against the wall and put his hand under her dress.
Airline flight attendant on Mr. Clinton’s 1992 campaign plane, who said Mr. Clinton exposed himself and grabbed her breasts.
In 1972, a 22-year-old woman told campus police at Yale University that she was sexually assaulted by Clinton, a law student at the college.
In 1974, a female student at the University of Arkansas complained that then-law school instructor Bill Clinton tried to prevent her from leaving his office during a conference. She said he groped her and forced his hand inside her blouse. She complained to her faculty advisor who confronted Clinton, but Clinton claimed the student ”came on” to him.
Paula Jones – Sexual Harrassment,. Character Assassination
She had asked to meet him because it would be ‘exciting’ to meet the governor, and she hoped it might lead to promotion. Instead, she said in court, she found herself telling him she was ‘not that kind of girl’.
It was a brief encounter and she alleged that Mr. Clinton took her hand, pulled her towards him, then said: ‘I love your curves.’
She tried to walk away, she said in a deposition, but ‘Mr. Clinton then walked over to the sofa, lowered his trousers and underwear, exposed his penis (which was erect) and told me to “kiss it.”‘ …
Jones delivers her own verdict on Hillary’s bid to become president, saying that her husband’s attitude towards women disqualifies Bill from re-entering the White House – while what she calls Hillary’s ‘lies’ disqualify her from the Oval Office.
‘There is no way that [Hillary] did not know what was going on, that women were being abused and accosted by her husband,’ she says. ‘They have both lied.’
Monica Lewinsky – Character Assassination
After lying to the American people to keep the Oval Office affair secret, Team Clinton and the DC Media ganged up on this 21-year-old intern to smear her as a crazy stalker.
—
A blue dress stained with the President’s DNA immediately shut down that media-enabled horror show.
Clinton was eventually impeached and disbarred for lying under oath about the affair. Under oath, when asked on three different occasions if he had an affair with Lewinsky, Clinton replied:
1. “No.”
2. “It’s certainly not the truth. It would not be the truth.”
3. “I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I’ve never had an affair with her.”
Flowers, who had a 12 year affair with Clinton, claims that Hillary Clinton ran a “war room” against her during the 1992 campaign, the goal being to “smear, defame, and harm” her in order to win the presidency.
Hillary trashed Flowers mercilessly as a liar and more in the 1992 interview embedded at the top of this post.
***
The list above doesn’t include the long list of women who claim to have had extramarital affairs, and in one case, an illegitimate child with Slick Willy.
[O]ne-time Little Rock prostitute who said Mr. Clinton fathered a child by her when he was the governor of Arkansas.
***
When Democrats and the DC Media and phony sexual assault activists like Lena Dunham insist we believe the victims, it is all a big fat lie.
Nothing, not even women who claim to have been raped, is more important to the Left than Power. These real and alleged victims are seen by the DC Media as sacrifices to a higher cause.",hillary
http://dailyheadlines.net/2016/11/clintons-panic-loretta-lynch-faces-federal-lawsuit-over-meeting-with-bill/,Clintons Panic: Loretta Lynch Faces Federal Lawsuit Over Meeting With Bill,"The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice and Loretta Lynch, demanding to know what really happened on that plane. Just a few days after the meeting with Bill Clinton, the Justice Department dropped it’s investigation into Hillary’s emails. Lynch was supposed to make the final decision whether to charge Hillary for her various crimes.
Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ, says:
‘This Administration has gone out of its way to hide information from the American public – information that is extremely troubling,’ said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ in a statement.
‘The stakes are high. The American people deserve a Justice Department with integrity.’
The ACLJ said it had already filed freedom of information requests to the Obama Justice Department and the FBI asking for details on the meeting. It said the FBI had acknowledged the request and agreed to expedite its processing, but the Justice Department had remained silent.
Lynch’s department said July 7 that it was formally closing its Clinton probe – largely a formality after Comey said the FBI was not pressing charges.
But now the ACLJ is demanding all messages that Lynch or her coworkers may have reviewed mentioning the rendezvous, names of everyone at the DOJ who has discussed the meeting, and any discussions about the press in relation to it, among other details.
Comey’s letter to Congress has left Clinton facing a political hullabaloo in the final days of the presidential race and dented her position in the polls.

http://dailyheadlines.net/2017/06/sen-chuck-grassley-opens-corruption-investigation-into-hillary-clinton/,Sen. Chuck Grassley Opens Corruption Investigation Into Hillary Clinton,"The democrats are about to pay for their false Trump/Russia narrative. Democrats know there is no there there, but want their voters to think otherwise. And they’re right. 59% of democrats believe that Russia actually changed the votes in order for Trump to win. This just proves they are utter morons because voting machines aren’t connected to the internet.
Sen Chuck Grassley on the other hand is going after Hillary for corruption and black mail. Witnesses who actually allow their names to be used have already gone public with Clinton’s scheme to save a donor to the Clinton Foundation from prison for embezzlement.
Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley has started an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton acted to prevent a Bangladeshi probe into a Clinton Foundation donor, The Daily Caller reports.
Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to the State Department requesting information regarding possible interference into a corruption investigation into Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi banker and economist who is also a close friend of the Clintons.
In May, The Daily Caller reported that during her time at the State Department, Clinton had put pressure on Bangladesh to stop a probe into Yunus and Grameen Bank. The son of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina even told The Daily Caller he had been threatened with an IRS audit if the investigation was not dropped.
“As I wrote in my August 2016 letter to Department of Justice, federal law requires that executive branch employees be disqualified from matters that have a direct and predictable effect on the employee’s own financial interests or the financial interests of those persons or organizations with which the employee is affiliated, such as those of a spouse, unless the employee first obtains an individual waiver or a regulatory exemption applies,” Grassley said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
“Once again, Secretary Clinton’s actions have raised reasonable suspicions that she violated these rules and undermined the public’s confidence in the integrity of the State Department.”
“If the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States, then that would be unacceptable,” he added.
“Co-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate. It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation.”
If Grassley continues his look into the Grameen Bank affair, it would be the first major post-election congressional inquiry into either the Democrat presidential nominee or the Clinton Foundation.",hillary
http://dailyheadlines.net/2017/01/the-podesta-group-lost-a-yuge-client-because-hillary-lost/,The Podesta Group Lost a Yuge Client Because Hillary Lost,"The Clinton Foundation isn’t the only big loser following Hillary’s humiliating defeat. Her campaign chief, John Podesta lost a yuge client they cannot replace. Alphabet, the parent company of Google has dropped the Podesta Group like a 20 pound horse turd.
Alphabet, who gave the Podesta Group their business in order to have access to President Clinton, waited a safe period then dumped the losers in favor of another company that might help them in the future. Let’s face it, the Podesta Group lost their most important asset when Hillary lost. Alphabet had been with the Podesta Brothers for 12 years, beginning when it appeared that Hillary would become the next president and stayed with them after she was named Secretary of State, saw the handwriting on the wall and bailed.
The Podesta Group — whose chairman, Tony Podesta, is a major Democratic fundraiser and the brother of Clinton’s former campaign manager — is no longer lobbying on behalf of Google, public disclosures show. The change coincided with Google’s bid to hire someone for “conservative outreach,” according to a December job advertisement.
Veteran lobbyists say it’s not unusual to see such shifts after an election. U.S. companies are responding to a power shift in Washington that put Republicans in charge — but with a president who sometimes departs from party orthodoxy on issues like taxes and trade. President Donald Trump’s practice of calling out companies for cost-overruns on government contracts and decisions to move jobs overseas has also changed the stakes for corporate lobbyists",hillary
http://dailyheadlines.net/2016/10/dhs-quietly-ends-hillarys-brother-eb-5-visa-scam/,DHS Quietly Ends Hillary’s Brother EB-5 Visa Scam,"Jeh Johnson and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has quietly shut down Tony Rodham, the deadbeat dad and son in law of Barbara Boxer, and his EB-5 visa scam. It had to be done quietly because some high powered democrats could be smeared over the scheme. First, there is Hillary Clinton who is the sister of Rodham. Then there is Gov Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, who was a huge beneficiary of the visa scam. Ands last but not least, there is Harry Reid, who used the EB-5 visas to benefit his son Rory who represents Las Vegas casinos who benefited to the tune of millions.
USCIS administers the EB-5 Program. Under this program, entrepreneurs (and their spouses and unmarried children under 21) are eligible to apply for a green card (permanent residence) if they:
Make the necessary investment in a commercial enterprise in the United States; and
Plan to create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for qualified U.S. workers.
This program is known as EB-5 for the name of the employment-based fifth preference visa that participants receive.
Congress created the EB-5 Program in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. In 1992, Congress created the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as the Regional Center Program. This sets aside EB-5 visas for participants who invest in commercial enterprises associated with regional centers approved by USCIS based on proposals for promoting economic growth.
Basically, Rodham, Reid and McAuliffe used the EB-5 program to sell visas for cash. The main problem is that many of the recipients of the EB-5 program were already turned down for visas due to national security concerns. So, how did they pull it off? Thanks to the fourth person who would have been hurt from the publicity, Alejandro Mayorkas. He approved the visas for Reid, McAuliffe and Rodham. As a reward, he was later nominated for the number two position at the DHS. When it became apparent that he wouldn’t survive a filibuster, Reid invoked the nuclear option and Mayorkas got the job.",hillary

Worries about Soros’ contribution most as of late were raised by the Hungarian PM, who a week ago lashed out at the Soros “realm” and blamed it for sending “huge amounts of cash and universal substantial big guns,” Fox News reports.
Be that as it may, days prior, Republican officials in Washington began making inquiries about whether U.S. assess dollars additionally were being utilized to finance Soros extends in the little, preservationist drove the nation of Macedonia.
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., drove a gathering of House administrators in keeping in touch with Envoy Jess Baily — an Obama representative — requesting answers.
“It appears that the U.S. government financed associations that have favored one side, particularly, the side of the communists, which is completely inadmissible. I think this is unlawful and we will inspect this case without bounds degree”
he said.
“We need a point by point oversight into what the organization has been doing in the course of recent years since we have been taking sides politically in different nations too, and there have been other comparable occurrences. That undermines U.S. open discretion and our tact as a rule. It is illegal and is inconceivable,” Smith said.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, likewise communicated worries about USAID cash setting off to Soros’ Open Society Establishments as a major aspect of a more extensive worry that the U.S. International safe haven hosts been taking sides in gathering legislative issues.
“I have gotten sound reports that, in the course of recent years, the US Mission to Macedonia has effectively interceded in the gathering legislative issues of Macedonia, and additionally the forming of its media condition and common society, regularly supporting gatherings of one political influence over another”
Lee said in his letter.
Hungarian Head administrator Viktor Orban a week ago tore the Hungary-conceived very rich person’s “trans-outskirt domain.” Orban has been one of the focal European voices taking a stand in opposition to the push by E.U. pioneers to retain Syrian displaced people and has been reprimanded for his hardline position.
“Huge bodied predators are swimming here in the waters. This is the trans-outskirt realm of George Soros, with huge amounts of cash and global overwhelming cannons,”
Orban said.
“It is bringing on inconvenience … that they are attempting furtively and with outside cash to impact Hungarian legislative issues,”
included Orban, an adversary of boundless migration, which Soros underpins.
Orban said Soros’ associations try to import a huge number of transients into Europe regardless of what Hungarians need.
Previous Macedonian Head administrator Nikola Gruevski said Soros has a “definitive impact” on his country’s governmental issues.
“On the off chance that it were not for George Soros behind it with every one of the millions he fills Macedonia, the whole system of NGOs, media, government officials, all around … the economy would be more grounded, we would have had all the more new employments,” he said as of late.
The letter from the State Office to Lee said USAID additionally as of late subsidized another Metro Engagement Extend which accomplices with four associations, including FOSM. It was not clear how much this venture would cost, but rather Smith put the figure at $9.5 million.
“The cash is extremely critical, with certainty there is still cash in the pipeline, from 2017 to 2021, 9.5 million,” Smith said in a current radio meeting with the Family Exploration Chamber’s Tony Perkins. “It’s one thing to do race checking, which is an extremely honorable purpose of ensuring there’s free and reasonable decisions, however, it’s very something else to back gatherings that Soros and his posse need to find in control of that nation.”
It isn’t the main time Soros has worked with the State Division. Among the messages of Clinton crusade administrator John Podesta discharged by Wikileaks was one from 2011 in which Soros asked Hillary Clinton to make a move in Albania over late exhibits in the capital of Tirana.
Soros requested that Clinton “apply the full weight of the universal group as a powerful influence for Head administrator Berisha and restriction pioneer Edi Rama to prevent facilitate open exhibits and to tone down open declarations” and delegate a senior European official as the middle person.
Inside a couple days, an emissary was obediently dispatched.
While Soros has frequently been a bogeyman for the American right, the liberal representative has kept an enduring weight and subsidizing of left-wing causes inside America too.
“This person is a bug with loads of networks,” GOP strategist Brad Blakeman revealed to Fox News’ “Technique Room.” “He controls various outside gatherings, where he utilizes his impact. We’ve seen it inside with Dark Lives Matter, the shows occurred after the inaugural — this is the thing that he does.”
After savage left-wing activists revolted at Berkeley in a challenge of an address by Breitbart proofreader Milo Yiannopoulos, The Day by day Guest detailed that the primary gathering behind the dissents — Deny Fascism — was supported by The Cooperation for Worldwide Equity — which thus is sponsored by The Tides Establishment, a Soros-subsidized gathering.
Soros likewise has given to Media Matters and has been a noteworthy money related benefactor to the Inside for American Advance, a liberal research organization established by Podesta.",hillary

Earlier this week, a man was arrested in Miami, Florida for threatening to kill Donald Trump in a disturbing online video. Now, it’s been revealed that the man is actually a close family friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton…
According to Daily Mail, Dominic Puopolo Jr., 51, is a member of a wealthy family that is known as top donors to Democratic causes. His family is so close to the Clintons that Hillary gave the eulogy at the funeral of Puopolo’s mother Sonia, who was killed in one of the jets that flew into the World Trade Center on 9-11. Puopolo was pictured seated near Hillary during his mother’s funeral a month later.
Hillary even reference Puopolo during her eulogy when she referenced “Dom Jr.’s latest computer wizardry.”
Puopolo was arrested as he left a Subway restaurant on Tuesday one day after he posted a video to Twitter in which he said, “This is the 16th of January 2017, I will be at the review/ inauguration and I will kill President Trump, President elect Trump today.” He is being held without bail at the Miami-Dade County Jail.
Puopolo has been active on Twitter in the last few months, posting photos of his “friend” Secretary of State John Kerry and of his mother with the Clintons.
His sister Sonia Tita Puopolo was a mainstay in Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, donating $4,000 to her presidential bid.

Stephanie Ruhle decided to ask her panel about it today.
RUHLE: Rick, an op-ed in The Atlantic said that Hillary Clinton's high profile, how she continues to tell her story in how the election went down over and over will actually hurt Democrats in the midterms. Do you agree with that?
Rick Tyler, a conservative political analyst for MSNBC doesn't even seem to want to acknowledge that nonsense, and goes right back talking about what they were talking about before.
TYLER: It's an interesting story, but Hillary Clinton is over. She's not coming back. I don't think she's going to run for president.
RUHLE: But I think that's the point. They're saying, ""Time to go. We don't wanna see you.""
TYLER: It's just drama. But more, if Rogers loses, then you can safely assume the Democrats will pick up 60 seats in the midterm elections...
Mark Thompson, though, isn't ready to let Ruhle get off so easily for bringing that ish about Clinton up in the first place.
THOMPSON: I think that's gonna happen even if she wins. And mind you, nobody's ever told a MALE candidate to shut up and stop appearing and stop talking. Bob Dole lost, he was all over TV doing commercials. Mitt Romney. John McCain was on a Sunday morning talk show every morning the Lord sent. Why on earth is Hillary Clinton being told to keep her mouth closed? Because SHE IS A WOMAN.
Thompson doesn't even mention Democratic losing presidential nominees Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, or Al Gore...or that the Democrats are just as bad as the Republicans about telling her to crawl into a cave and disappear.
It's not as if she's everywhere all over the place flooding the airwaves. She wrote a book. She went on a book tour. She's asked to speak in some erudite academic and political spaces, and she accepts. In those settings, she's asked about the election, and other things about which she has expertise. She answers. That's it. She is not clamoring for the spotlight, and she is not on TV doing paid ads for vaginal dryness. (I wrote that just to gross out Trump, if he's reading.) She is living her life.
The ones bringing her up most are the REPUBLICANS, because they know nothing fires up their base like Hillary hate. Come to think of it, the Mainstream Media outlets run a close second... they know that Hillary hate fires up their viewership. I see you, Stephanie Ruhle.
Thank goodness, so does Rick Tyler and Mark Thompson.",hillary

http://dailypolitics.us/2017/08/16/4-times-google-was-linked-directly-to-hillary-clinton/,4 Times Google Was Linked Directly to Hillary Clinton,"Google and its founders have a long history of siding with the political left. Breitbart News has put together four of the most egregious links between Google and the Clinton campaign.
As Google comes under fire for its recent firing of engineer James Damore, who claimed that the company shows a blatant bias against anyone who doesn’t follow Google groupthink, Breitbart News has compiled a list of times Google was shown to take a blatantly leftist stance including their ties to the 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.
1: Eric Schmidt wanted to be ‘Head Outside Advisor’ to Clinton campaign
Alphabet Inc. CEO Eric Schmidt was revealed to have expressed his desire to act work with the Clinton presidential campaign in documents published by the whistleblowing organization WikiLeaks. The emails between Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook show that Schmidt met with Podesta and was interested in assuming the role of “head outside advisor.”
“I met with Eric Schmidt tonight,” wrote Podesta. “As David reported, he’s ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc. He was more deferential on structure than I expected. Wasn’t pushing to run through one of his existing firms. Clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn’t seem like he wanted to push others out.” Podesta further pushes Mook to meet with Schmidt, writing, “He’s still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon. I think it’s worth doing. You around? If you are, and want to meet with him, maybe the four of us can get on the phone in the am.”
2: Eric Schmidt Created ‘The Groundwork’ To Help Clinton’s Online Campaign
Schmidt was instrumental in the formation of “The Groundwork”, an online startup company that aimed to place Hillary Clinton in the white house. The Groundwork was the highest paid tech service company to the Clinton campaign, receiving $136,131 during the third quarter and $313,349 through the first 9 months of 2015.
Michael Slaby, the CEO of The Groundwork, also served as the Chief Technology Officer for President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, stated, “We’re not trying to obfuscate anything, we’re just trying to keep our heads down and do stuff.” Schmidt also worked closely on Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign with Obama lieutenant David Plouffe, who stated that Schmidt, “helped recruit talent, choose technology and coach the campaign manager, Jim Messina, on the finer points of leading a large organization.”
3: Google Actively Suppressed Negative Search Results Relating To Clinton
A report from psychologist Robert Epstein revealed that Google manipulated search results related to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election that had the potential to “shift as many as 3 million votes” according to Epstein. Epstein along with his colleagues at the American Institute for Behavioral Research (AIBRT) became interested in a videopublished by Matt Lieberman of Sourcefed which claimed that Google searches suppressed negative information about Hillary Clinton while other search engines such as Bing and Yahoo showed accurate results.
Epstein and AIBRT tested hundreds of different search terms related to the 2016 election, using Yahoo and Bing search as a control. Epsteins report stated,
It is somewhat difficult to get the Google search bar to suggest negative searches related to Mrs. Clinton or to make any Clinton-related suggestions when one types a negative search term. Bing and Yahoo, on the other hand, often show a number of negative suggestions in response to the same search terms. Bing and Yahoo seem to be showing us what people are actually searching for; Google is showing us something else — but what, and for what purpose?
As for Google Trends, as Lieberman reported, Google indeed withholds negative search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms show high popularity in Trends. We have also found that Google often suggests positive search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms are nearly invisible in Trends. The widely held belief, reinforced by Google’s own documentation, that Google’s search suggestions are based on “what other people are searching for” seems to be untrue in many instances.
Google tries to explain away such findings by saying its search bar is programmed to avoid suggesting searches that portray people in a negative light. As far as we can tell, this claim is false; Google suppresses negative suggestions selectively, not across the board. It is easy to get autocomplete to suggest negative searches related to prominent people, one of whom happens to be Mrs. Clinton’s opponent.
Epstein then hypothesized that Google directly altered search results in an attempt to influence the 2016 election,
Without whistleblowers or warrants, no one can prove Google executives are using digital shenanigans to influence elections, but I don’t see how we can rule out that possibility. There is nothing illegal about manipulating people using search suggestions and search rankings — quite the contrary, in fact — and it makes good financial sense for a company to use every legal means at its disposal to support its preferred candidates.
Epstein stated that despite being a Clinton supporter he didn’t think it would be, “right for her to win the presidency because of the invisible, large-scale manipulations of a private company. That would make democracy meaningless.”
4: Julian Assange Claimed That Google Was ‘Directly Engaged’ In The Clinton Campaign
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange spoke via video link to the “New Era of Journalism: Farewell to Mainstream” forum in Moscow when he made the claim that tech giant Google was complicit in the running of Hillary Clinton’s digital campaign. Assange pointed out that many high up Google employee names appear within Clinton’s leaked email transcripts, a searchable list of which WikiLeaks has compiled. Jared Cohen, the founder of ‘Google Ideas’ – now rebranded as ‘Jigsaw,’ appears frequently on the list. Cohen’s team at Google was revealed to be working with Clinton alongside Al Jazeera in attempts to influence regime change in Syria following the publishing of Clinton’s emails by Wikileaks.
“We should understand that Google… is intensely aligned with U.S. exceptionalism… personally at the top aligned with Hillary Clinton’s election campaign and almost certainly once Hillary Clinton becomes president, those people in Google, like Jared Cohen, will be placed into positions around the new Clinton presidency” said Assange, heavily implying that Google and it’s employees could directly benefit from a Clinton presidency. Assange further emphasized Google’s control over their users data, “Google controls 80 percent of the smartphone market through its control of Android and if you control the device itself – that people use to read – then anything that they connect to through that device you have control over as well.”
“Google has gotten into bed with the Obama administration in a very significant way,” stated Assange. “It is the company that visits the White House more than any other – averaged once per week in the last four years.”
All of these are examples of Google’s dedication to the establishment left and their attempts to influence politics directly to benefit the Clintons. The recent revelations about Google’s dedication to leftist ideology within their workplace environment should come as a surprise to no one, but whether the company will learn from the backlash against them following the firing of James Damore is yet to be seen.

Here’s the real takeaway quote, the one that should be repeated over and over again:
Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.
They also obtained an eyewitness account – backed by documents – indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton‘s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.
The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.
Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.
Barack Obama as President of the United States and Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State were fully engaged in a global pay-to-play scheme which greatly expanded Russia’s nuclear capability.

http://dcwhispers.com/report-nsa-offered-give-fbi-hillary-clintons-missing-emails-comey-said-no/,REPORT: NSA Offered To Give FBI All Of Hillary Clinton’s Missing Emails. Comey Said NO.,"The New York Post’s John Crudele had an interesting column outlining how the bogus Democrat/Media/Deep State instigated Trump investigation is backfiring on Democrats as the American people grow increasingly weary of repeated allegations without actual proof.
Beyond that fatigue is something even more concerning for Democrats. The investigation is actually shedding light on wrongdoing by figures like Hillary Clinton and James Comey – NOT Donald Trump.
Check it out:
————
There’s a lot going on in the Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump/Russia investigation that all the highfalutin’ newspapers that cover politics are still trying to ignore.
Well, investors had better know this stuff before it bites them in the assets. So here goes.
Numerous reports coming out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week said that former FBI Director James Comey made the decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution long before he even interviewed key witnesses, including Hillary.
Remember, the Republicans now control this committee. So bad news isn’t going to be stifled anymore.
Clinton, you probably remember, “lost” her private emails, which she’d been storing on a personal computer server. Comey chastised her harshly in a televised speech but then said there was a unanimous decision not to recommend prosecution.
Clinton’s emails, which were stolen by the Russians, have never been found. But as I’ve mentioned numerous times, the messages are still in the possession of the National Security Agency (NSA), which offered to give them to the FBI.
Comey turned down that offer, according to a source who has been very reliable.
I’ve also mentioned that Comey fibbed when he said his agents unanimously agreed that prosecution was unnecessary. In fact, my source says that FBI agents were irate about the decision not to go after Clinton.
The controversy got pretty intense, which may be why Comey forced agents who worked on the Clinton matter to sign additional nondisclosure agreements.
There was another important development last week when a federal judge ordered the FBI to disclose more details about how it handled the Clinton investigation. That could put Comey in a hotter spot than he’s already in.
What’s this got to do with the investigation of Trump and any influence the Russians may have had over the last presidential election? Absolutely nothing.
But as I’ve said before, any investigation of Trump was likely to backfire when investigators started to look at the Democrats and their dealings.
And that’s exactly what is starting to happen.
Full report: HERE
——————-
Clearly James Comey was involved in covering up for Hillary Clinton while at the same time weaponizing the FBI to be used against Donald Trump – both very serious miscarriages of justice.
Here’s the thing – Comey has already indicated how his actions were colored by input from then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the infamous secret snakes-on-a-plane meeting with Bill Clinton.
Loretta Lynch answered only to Barack Obama and Valerie Jarrett.
Indeed.

This effort took place over several months, including illegal surveillance of private citizens as well as widespread collusion with influential Establishment/Social Media figures.
And now the Deep State is trying desperately to cover its tracks.
Via The Washington Examiner:
A third deadline has now passed for the FBI and Justice Department to give the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed documents related to the Trump dossier. And for a third time, the bureau has not produced the material.
…The Russia allegations were compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who was commissioned by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which is thought to have been paid for the work by wealthy supporters of Hillary Clinton. The FBI reportedly considered taking over the dossier project in the fall of 2016, when the campaign was at its height, leading Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to say the dossier matter raised “questions about the FBI’s independence from politics.”
…Both Grassley and the House Intelligence Committee have been interested in learning if the FBI ever used the “salacious and unverified” dossier as a basis for requesting surveillance on anyone in the Trump circle. Those questions only intensified this week with reports that the FBI wiretapped Trump associate and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort during the transition period.
Four weeks ago, on Aug. 24, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the FBI and Justice Department, seeking all internal FBI reports “incorporating, relying on, or referring to” information provided by Steele, his sources, or Fusion GPS. The committee also asked for documents on any FBI or Justice “efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate” Steele’s information. And the subpoena sought any surveillance applications that included any information or were based on any information, provided by Steele.
Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes originally set a Sept. 1 deadline for production of the dossier documents. The FBI did not comply. Nunes then extended the deadline to Sept. 14. The FBI did not comply. Then Nunes extended the deadline again, to Sept. 22. Now, again, the FBI has not complied.
————–
The reason for the delay is simple. The fabricated “Trump dossier” represents a direct link between the anti-Trump factions within the U.S. government, the Hillary Clinton campaign, and the then-Obama White House. Some very powerful forces want this evidence buried – forever.
The will of the voters was nearly supplanted by a small group of powerful elites. Those elites have since retreated back into the shadows and want nothing to do with the light of truth shining upon them. The entirety of the false Trump-Russia narrative has been little more than providing cover for their criminal wrongdoing.

When they were confronted about this suspicious meeting, they claimed that it was just to talk about golf and grandchildren. That was an obvious lie.
“According to The New York Post, FBI agents who worked on the Hillary Clinton email investigation are privately upset with the decision not to charge her and are quietly alleging that Attorney General Loretta Lynch must have struck a deal with her husband Bill Clinton during their private meeting.
The Post cites anonymous sources in the FBI who claim that agents investigating Clinton were subject to higher-than-usual scrutiny. Agents had to sign “Case Briefing Acknowledgment” forms, non-disclosure agreements keeping them from speaking to anyone about the case unless called to testify. As a result, agents cannot go public with their opinions of the case, whether they agree with the final result or not.
Some of those agents privately tell the Post that they are “disappointed” with FBI director James Comey‘s decision not to recommend charges. Some were even more vocal: ‘FBI agents believe there was an inside deal put in place after the Loretta Lynch/Bill Clinton tarmac meeting,’ said one source.”
Of course they struck a deal. Comey protected Hillary and even if he recommended prosecution, Lynch wouldn’t have pursued it. The whole mess stinks. I hope the new FBI Director goes after the fraud and Sessions prosecutes her to the fullest extent of the law.
How many people being investigated send their spouse to a private meeting with the prosecutor? ZERO. That’s not how it works. Bribery or threats to the prosecutor is a crime. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the only logical reason for Bill to meet Lynch was to make a deal.",hillary

Unaware that all of the mansions had actually been owned by Clinton, each participant attempted to link other candidates such as Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio to the extravagant properties.
After several rounds of the game, Phillips says the participants were shocked to learn that Clinton had lived in all four homes, which hold a total value of more than $31 million.
“What, really? You’re pulling my leg,” one man said in response.
Nearly every respondent reacted similarly, with some even stating that the revelation had altered their opinions on the upcoming Presidential race.

http://dailynewscycle.com/2017/08/lynch-email-alias-elizabeth-carlisle/,Lynch used email alias ‘Elizabeth Carlisle’ to write about Clinton tarmac meeting,"Sponsored by Revcontent
Loretta Lynch, Former Attorney General, has decided it would be a good idea to go by the alias “Elizabeth Carlisle” in emails for government business.
According to sources, Lynch has been using another name while doing work for a long time.
This action of using an alias name has become more and more common for top government officials. Many of them feel they need a separate email account so they are not flooded by minor details.
However, many sets of emails by top officials are creating a firestorm of controversy.
According to foxnews,
Loretta Lynch used the alias “Elizabeth Carlisle” for official emails as attorney general, including those related to her infamous tarmac meeting last summer with former President Clinton.
The emails were included in 413 pages of Justice Department documents provided to conservative watchdog groups Judicial Watch and American Center for Law and Justice.
Top federal officials using email aliases is not illegal or new, considering others in the former Obama administration also used them, arguing security concerns and spam to their official email addresses swamping their in-boxes.
Eric Holder, Lynch’s predecessor, used “Lew Alcindor,” the former name of retired NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
However, critics of the practice argue that such aliases can result in some requested emails to and from officials going undetected.
Lynch used the alias to help craft responses to media requests about the meeting, the documents show.
And former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was at the center of the agency’s targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, also used an alias — Toby Miles.
Internet sleuths say Elizabeth Carlisle is the birth name of Lynch’s maternal grandmother. But an actress who has done a number of sultry roles — including “prostitute” and “tipsy” — also has that name.
The Lynch documents were provided to the groups in connection with lawsuits seeking information about the June 27, 2016, meeting on the tarmac of a Phoenix airport.
The meeting came amid an FBI investigation into whether Clinton’s wife, then the Democratic presidential nominee, had revealed classified information when using private email servers while secretary of state.
About a week later, FBI Director James Comey concluded the case by saying Clinton was “extremely careless,” but recommended the Justice Department not pursue criminal charges.
In Senate testimony earlier this year, Comey said the meeting was a “deciding factor” in his decision to act alone to update the public on the investigation.
He also said Lynch had directed him to call the investigation “a matter,” which “confused” him.
The former president left his private plane and boarded Lynch’s uninvited. Lynch said in the aftermath that they talked about grandchildren and other matters, but that the investigation was not discussed.
However, Lynch later said she “regrets” having allowed the meeting.
Lynch’s attorney Robert Raben on Monday told The Daily Caller that Justice Department staffers who process Freedom of Information Act requests are aware of the alias.
He also said the agency acknowledged in February 2016 that Lynch was using the Elizabeth Carlisle alias.",hillary
http://dailynewscycle.com/2017/07/executed-17-families-of-seal-team-6-say-chopper-crash-was-an-inside-job-by-hillary-obama/,EXECUTED: 17 FAMILIES OF SEAL TEAM 6 SAY CHOPPER CRASH Was an INSIDE JOB by HILLARY & OBAMA,"Source | Back in August [2013], I told you that Extortion 17, the downing of a Chinook helicopter with members of SEAL team 6 on board (those that allegedly carried out the raid on Osama bin Laden), could be Barack Obama’s biggest scandal and one of his administration’s biggest acts of treason.
This Article was updated July 17,2017
That report came after an interview I conducted with Billy Vaughn, father of slain Navy SEAL Aaron Vaughn, who told Freedom Outpost that he wanted answers and those who were responsible for his son’s death to be held accountable. Now, many of the families believe that the incident, which has been deemed the largest loss of life in the Afghan war theater (38 deaths, including nearly two dozen Navy SEALs), was an inside job.
The Washington Times reports:
The investigative file made available to The Washington Times shows that the helicopter’s landing zone was not properly vetted for threats nor protected by gunships, while commanders criticized the mission as too rushed and the conventional Chinook chopper as ill-suited for a dangerous troop infiltration.
…
Larry Klayman, who runs the nonprofit watchdog group Freedom Watch, has filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Pentagon, as well as the Air Force, Army and Navy. He wants a judge to order the military to turn over an array of documents under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. He said the Defense Department stonewalled his written requests, so Freedom Watch went to court last month and succeeded in forcing the government to turn over records.
For the first time, Mr. Klayman allowed The Washington Times to view the military’s investigative files turned over to family members two years ago.
“The families of our fallen heroes, who I am proud to represent, need closure to this tragedy,” Mr. Klayman said. “There are many unanswered questions and the military’s explanations of the causes of the crash do not add up.”
He said families also want changes to the military’s restrictive rules of engagement that made it more difficult for U.S. helicopter pilots to fire back at the Taliban fighters they believed brought down the Chinook.
“The families also want our military’s rules of engagement to be changed, as a testament to and in honor of their dead sons,” Mr. Klayman said. “When our nation enters into battle, it must be to win the battle, not the ‘hearts and minds’ of the Islamic jihadist enemy and the Muslim civilian population it uses as human shields.”
He also wants to know the identities of Afghan soldiers onboard, and why the aircraft’s black box, washed away in a fierce rainstorm, was never found — even though it has a homing device.
“We want to make sure our fallen heroes are respected and that answers are provided,” he said.
About a possible insider betrayal, he says: “We’re not saying that happened, but it needs to be explored because increasingly Americans are being killed at the hands of Afghans.”
While many of the family members expressed sentiments very similar to those of Billy Vaughn during our interview, it isn’t just the families of those lost that are questioning what happened. Many military personnel who were involved that night have questioned the operation afterwards.
“One of the other things that we did talk about — kind of what you’re hitting on, sir, is about the fact that, you know, for three hours we had been burning holes in the sky,” the navigator aboard the AC-130 gunship that loitered for three hours over Tangi Valley. “You’ve got [Apaches] flying around, so there’s a lot of noise going on and, basically, this entire valley knows that there’s something happening in this area. So, to do an infil on the X or Y, you know, having that element of surprise in the beginning of an operation is good, but by the time we’ve been there for three hours, and the party’s up, bringing in another aircraft like that, you know, may not be the most tactically sound decision.”Some of the families believe their sons were betrayed by the Afghan government and that someone inside tipped off the Taliban. This would be right in line with the “green on blue” attacks that have escalated in Afghanistan, resulting in the loss of many American lives.
The families also believes that the SEALs took off in the wrong aircraft, something that Billy Vaughn pointed out during our interview. A special operations officers also confirmed to the Times this was the case.
“In this case, the CH-47 was used in a completely inappropriate manner given its design and the result was the deaths of everyone aboard,” the officer said.
“Tier 1 personnel must be employed with careful planning,” he added. “The cost and time to train them means that using them in such a haphazard manner as a reaction force in this context places critical personnel at too great a risk, especially in this concentration on such a noncritical mission.”
Both SEAL Team 6 and Army Delta Force are considered Tier 1 personnel.
The report also shows a discrepancy between whether the Chinook had Apache escorts or not, or whether the escorts failed to properly scout the landing zone.
Additionally, there is the question of why many of the soldiers were ordered to be cremated by the Army, including Charles Strange’s son Michael, who obtained a copy of Michael’s autopsy report and photographs of his body that showed no signs of fire damage.
“There’s nothing wrong with the body except for his ankle, but they claimed everybody was burned beyond recognition, yet there he was lying there whole and intact,” Strange said. “His hair and arms weren’t burned, and there was no sign of smoke in his lungs. When I called the command up and asked them about this they seem shocked that I had the photo. They told me ‘we’ll get back to you,’ but they never did.”
“Why did they cremate my boy? We are Christians and do not believe in cremation; there was no reason for them to do that,” Strange said.
There’s also that little issue that came up when 6 Navy SEALs’ funerals were conducted by a Muslim Cleric that condemned them to Hell during the service.
“Over two years after Extortion 17 was shot down, the families still have these unanswered questions,” said Klayman. “All of this raises the distinct possibility of a cover-up as to what really happened. We don’t know what happened, and none of these answers are forthcoming.”
Qari Tahir was thought to be the top leader in the area, and his home was raided by Army Rangers on that night in an attempt to kill or kidnap him. Following the Extortion 17 crash, a month later NATO command in Kabul announced it had killed Tahir with a precise airstrike as he stood alongside a fellow terrorist.
I must say that this has to be the clearest tying up of loose ends I’ve seen. A SEAL team allegedly takes out the most wanted jihadist in the world (I still question that entire story line), then they get taken out by the Taliban, then the Taliban leader gets taken out.
The most important question on my mind is, who in the Obama administration was involved? We know at least Leon Panetta and Joe Biden had loose lips when it came to keeping the SEAL team’s identity classified. However, Obama and his administration have not been held accountable for one single crime they’ve committed in his five years in office. Will Klayman and the families be the first to bring them to justice?",hillary
http://dailynewscycle.com/2017/06/comey-testimony/,"Comey Testimony Backfires on Dems: Implicates Obama, Lynch & Clinton In Vast Criminal Conspiracy","ELDER PATRIOT – Former F.B.I. Director James Comey testified for three hours before the Senate Intelligence Committee today in what was supposed to be the Democrats’ big moment. Comey was expected blow the lid off the Russian-Trump collusion investigation and charge President Trump with obstructing justice to boot.
Oops.
Instead Comey’s testimony blew up in the faces of hopeful Democrats when, under questioning by Committee Chairmen Richard Burr whether the Obama administration’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s secret meeting (even the Secret Service agents assigned to each were told to leave) with Bill Clinton had any affect on his handling of Hillary’s email probe he answered that it forced him to act in a manner necessary to protect the credibility of the investigation, the Department of Justice, and the F.B.I.
He also charged Lynch with ordering him to call the email investigation an “email matter” instead so as to provide Clinton with some wiggle room on the campaign trail.
Comey was concerned because he became convinced that it was tainting the public’s perception of the independence of the investigation and, with it, the Justice Department. He decided to make the bureau’s findings about Clinton public.
But wait, it gets worse for the Democrats who colluded to protect Madame Hillary and had been counting on Comey to save their sorry asses.
Comey also admitted to leaking, through an intermediary, to the New York Times. This last fact may endear him to partisan Democrats but any objective observer knows that leaking information to the press that may be pertinent to a criminal or counter-intelligence investigation is verboten.
The Comey interrogation was such a resounding defeat for the Democrats’ that it is reminiscent of this early Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) knockout of Sonny Liston.
The Democrats – including Obama, Lynch, and Clinton – may very well face prosecution for their poisonous attack on the president of the United States and their lawless actions while they had power.
For all of the pain they caused the new president, and for all of the pain they caused the American people who have had to endure the delay Trump’s agenda to revive the economy and his efforts to make America safer, the likelihood increases that Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp” becomes more than just a campaign chant.",hillary

The former US presidential challenger said no deal would put pressure on businesses and the disruption could be “quite serious”.
Britain must not pin its hopes on a US deal because Donald Trump “doesn’t believe in trade” and was on the verge of pulling out of existing agreements with its biggest trading partners, she warned.
Mrs Clinton told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I think it would be a very big disadvantage to Britain.
'No deal' would be ""a very big disadvantage to Britain"" – @HillaryClinton talks #Brexit with #marr. Full interview on Sunday, BBC One at 9am pic.twitter.com/9p25fOuuSi
“I mean, no deal meaning no preferential trade deals, which means products in Britain would not have the kind of easy access to the European market that you’ve had under EU membership.
“It could very well mean that there would be more pressure on businesses in Britain, if not to leave completely, at least also have sites and employment elsewhere in Europe. I think that the disruption for Britain could be, you know, quite serious.”
President Trump has said it is “possible” the US will pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) struck more than two decades ago with Mexico and Canada.
Asked about the UK’s trading future with America, Mrs Clinton said: “Well, yes, but you’re making a trade deal with someone who says he doesn’t believe in trade. So I’m not quite sure how that’s going to play out over the next few years.
“He looks like he’s on the verge of taking (us) out of NAFTA rather than reworking NAFTA. Our biggest trading partners in the world are Canada and Mexico. So these will have real world economic consequences.”
The former US secretary of state accused Leave campaigners of giving “fabricated” information to voters during the referendum and raised the role of data mining and analysis company Cambridge Analytica.
An investigation was launched by the Information Commissioner’s Office into the firm after complaints the Leave.EU campaign, backed by ex-Ukip leader Nigel Farage, had not declared its role in its campaign.
Mrs Clinton said: “Looking at the Brexit vote now, it was a precursor to some extent of what happened to us in the United States. Whatever the role Cambridge Analytica played for example. But the amount of fabricated, false information that your voters were given by the Leave campaign.”
Hillary Clinton is part of the global elite that want to overturn Brexit. We will resist.
She added: “You had, you know, Mr Farage campaigning for Trump and the like. You know, the big lie is a very potent tool, and we’ve somewhat kept it at bay in western democracies, partly because of the freedom of the press.
“But we’ve now developed advocacy press. You know, obviously there have always been newspapers who leaned right or leaned left and they kind of counterbalanced each other. But given the absolutely explosive spread of online news and sites that have sprung up that are very effective at propagating false stories, we’ve got some thinking to do … but there has to be some basic level of fact and evidence in our politics.

They should not be able to get away with breaking the law under any circumstances. Our founding fathers spoke of liberty and justice for all, and I put much emphasis on the ""all"" part of that speech. Average people are thrown in prison for much less severe crimes than our politicians commit daily, and the same should go for everybody, especially people in charge of upholding, accommodating, and ""protecting"" the law.

This rumor is supposed to have originated within the NYPD investigating Anthony Weiner for “sexting” a minor in another state.
The ""Lolita Express"" Sex Ring
According to the accusations, there are at least six members of Congress, several top leadership from federal agencies, and others all implicated in a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring, called ""Lolita Express"". This was supposedly directly running with the Clinton Foundation as a front.
Will this be the fatal shot? NYPD is talking about a Child Porn ring involvement.
This is NOT confirmed, yet. But could this be the big 'October Surprise'?
Is it possible that Huma and Weiner backed up ALL of Hillary's email to their laptop as ""life insurance"" in case she turned on them?

The deal was struck after Reps. Bob Goodlatte, (R-VA), and Trey Gowdy, (R-S.C.), met this month with the U.S. attorney, John Lausch, who has been selected to respond to Republican demands for documents.
“We look forward to reviewing the information to better understand the decisions made by the Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017,” Goodlatte and Gowdy said in a joint statement. “Congress has a constitutional responsibility to preserve the integrity of our justice system by ensuring transparency and accountability of actions taken.”
Goodlatte subpoenaed the Justice Department last month for records of the investigation, which ended in July 2016 without charges being filed against Clinton. The congressman met with Lausch two weeks ago about the documents.
Fox news reports that the DOJ will release 1,000 documents by Wednesday morning that will show how the DOJ and the FBI mishandled the Clinton email probe while also probing President Trump in the Russian collusion investigation.
President Trump and Republican lawmakers have accused the DOJ of “stonewalling” lawmakers who are looking into the FBI’s actions during the 2016 presidential election.
Gowdy explains that he needs to see the clean and unredacted version of these documents from the FBI so that lawmakers clearly understand what actually happened during this investigation and to see if it was lawful.
Some of the redactions that have been discovered are simply embarrassing stories, one about former FBI agent Peter Strzok, which Gowdy says is not enough justification for something to be redacted and is why a clean version needs to be released straight away. Gowdy continued that if there is anything involving security issues for the nation then those should and can be redacted as well.",hillary
https://www.dcstatesman.com/bombshell-obama-doj-appointee-pressured-andrew-mccabe-to-shut-down-clinton-foundation-case/,BOMBSHELL: Obama DOJ Appointee Pressured Andrew McCabe To ‘Shut Down’ Clinton Foundation Case,"As deputy FBI director, Andrew McCabe received a phone call on August 12, 2016, less than three months before the presidential election, from the Obama Justice Department, in which he apparently was pressured to shut down the FBI’s investigation into the Clinton Foundation, reports CNS News.
The Clinton Foundation (CF) has been criticized as simply being a multi-million dollar pay-for-play operation to buy access to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill Clinton.
On Friday, April 13, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the Department of Justice issued a report on McCabe, detailing how he had “lacked candor,” even under oath, on four occasions that dealt with a leak to the Wall Street Journal. For this misconduct, the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility recommended that McCabe be fired, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions eventually did on January 29, 2018.
However, the OIG also reports that the FBI was investigating the Clinton Foundation in 2016, an election year involving Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She already was being investigated for her illicit use of a private email server — by McCabe and other FBI agents — when she was Secretary of State under President Barack Obama.
The OIG report states, “McCabe told the OIG that on August 12, 2016, he received a telephone call from PADAG [Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General] regarding the FBI’s handling of the CF Investigation (the “PADAG call”).
“McCabe said that PADAG expressed concerns about FBI agents taking overt steps in the CF [Clinton Foundation] Investigation during the presidential campaign.
“According to McCabe, he pushed back, asking ‘are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?’
“McCabe told us that the conversation was ‘very dramatic’ and he never had a similar confrontation like the PADAG call with a high-level Department official in his entire FBI career.”
Why is a top official from the Obama Justice Department apparently pressuring then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe to shut down the Bureau’s investigation of the Clinton Foundation?
Commenting on the matter, J. Christian Adams, an attorney who formerly served (2005-2008) in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, said, “This is a top-level DOJ official who called the FBI and said shut down the Hillary [Clinton] Foundation investigation.”
“What kind of Justice Department do we have, that a couple weeks before the election, that presidential political appointees are calling the No. 2 guy at the FBI, essentially saying, give Hillary a pass?” said Adams. “That’s in the OIG report! That’s the real bombshell!”
The Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General serves under the deputy attorney general. In 2016, the deputy attorney general was Sally Yates.
She was fired by President Trump on Jan. 30, 2017 because she refused to enforce the administration’s policy on limiting immigration from certain countries.
The Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2016 was Bill Baer. But it is not known whether he was the person who called McCabe on Aug. 12, 2016.
Baer was initially selected by President Barack Obama in 2012 to serve as assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division. Baer currently works at the law firm Arnold & Porter.

https://www.dcstatesman.com/russian-bribery-plot-involving-clintons-uncovered-fbi/,Russian Bribery Plot Involving Clintons Uncovered By FBI,"In 2010 the FBI uncovered a mammoth Russian bribery plot involving the Clintons and the Clinton foundation concerning Vladimir Putin’s nuclear ambitions. But the DOJ failed to act for four years. Meanwhile, the Obama Administration approved uranium deals giving Putin unprecedented control of American interests. Officials working for Russian nuclear interests were “engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering” all under Obama’s nose.
The FBI acquired a confidential source working in the Russian nuclear industry. He tipped them off with financial records, covert recordings, and emails going back to 2009. The source showed that Moscow had infiltrated an American uranium trucking company through bribery. This was a clear violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Furthermore, they found documents, combined with eyewitness accounts that these same Russian officials sent millions of dollars to the U.S. to benefit the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton was serving on the body that would give a favorable ruling for Moscow regarding their uranium takeover bid.
But instead of acting on the overwhelming evidence, Obama’s DOJ sat on it:
“The racketeering scheme was conducted ‘with the consent of higher level officials’ in Russia who ‘shared the proceeds’ from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.
“Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.
“The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.”
On the campaign trail Donald Trump used this information to slam Hillary Clinton. But her spokesman denied involvement and insisted she “never intervened… on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.” In 2011 the Obama Administration approved Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell uranium to American nuclear power plants:
“’The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,’ a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.
“The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.
“That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.”
Then Attorney General Eric Holder was also on the Committee on Foreign Investment when the deal was approved. There is no evidence that the FBI or the DOJ told committee members about their investigation. The investigation was supervised by Rod Rosenstein, who is now the deputy attorney general. Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who has come under fire after his wife accepted political donations from Clinton confidante Terry McAuliffe, was also involved.
The Russian probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, who is investigation Russian collusion as a special investigator, was still heading the FBI. It ended in 2015 when James Comey was FBI Director. Trump fired Comey earlier in 2017. All those involved who were eventually arrested reached plea deals. And the relationship between Russia and the Clinton Foundation was ignored in the final court case:
“The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.
“The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.”
Key members in the FBI and on Capitol Hill were never briefed on the investigation. Former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) who was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee at the time was never briefed. The assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases Ronald Hosko was never briefed either.
Considering the Obama Administration was in the midst of negotiating such a high-profile uranium deal with Russian interests, the investigation should have warranted notification to key players. In other words, something is incredibly fishy here. Rogers admitted so himself:
“’Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,’ he said. ‘The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.’”

On Sunday, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defended NFL players who knelt during the national anthem. She claimed to kneel is a “reverent” position that is not against “our anthem or our flag.”
The former Democratic first lady was promoting her book, “What Happened,” at the Southbank Centre’s London Literature Festival. During the foreign visit, she urged Democrats and colleagues to use the issue against President Trump, saying people should resist “what are very clear dog-whistles” to the Trump base, citing the example of the kneeling, protesting NFL players.
“That’s what black athletes kneeling was all about,” she said, in response to a question about ways to resist the White House. ”That’s not against our anthem or our flag. Actually, kneeling is a reverent position. It was to demonstrate in a peaceful way against racism and injustice in our criminal system.”
Clinton urged the Democratic Party and her supporters to continue to “resist” Trump, saying, “I think it would be a grave error for Democrats to recede from those fights, so, therefore, we have to stand up, fight back, resist.”
Clinton went on to equate the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections to the September 11 terrorist attack in 2001.
“We have really well-respected security and intelligence veterans saying this was a kind of cyber 9/11, in the sense that it was a direct attack to American institutions,” she said to a listening crowd. “That may sound dramatic but we know they tried to recruit into election systems, not just social media propaganda.”

Written by DML
The FBI used to be the most respected agency in the country. If you were part of the FBI, you were part of an elite group of men and women. But James Comey put a stain on the agency, and I’m doubting the American people will ever trust the agency again like it once did.
The watchdog group Judicial Watch put out a press release on Friday announcing the FBI has located 30 pages of documents related to the meeting between former attorney general Loretta Lynch, and former president Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Arizona during the 2016 election.
Originally, the FBI said they didn’t have the documents. But suddenly, they’ve changed their tune.
Please take the time to read the press release from Judicial Watch. Please share this post far and wide.
FULL RELEASE:
(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch was informed yesterday by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that the FBI has located 30 pages of documents related to the June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, and proposes non-exempt material be produced no later than November 30, 2017 (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:16-cv-02046)).
The new documents are being sent to Judicial Watch in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the Justice Department failed to comply with a July 7, 2016, FOIA request seeking the following:
All FD-302 forms prepared pursuant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server during her tenure.
All records of communications between any agent, employee, or representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding, concerning, or related to the aforementioned investigation. This request includes, but is not limited to, any related communications with any official, employee, or representative of the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President, the Democratic National Committee, and/or the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.
All records related to the meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016.
The FBI originally informed Judicial Watch they did not locate any records related to the tarmac meeting. However, in a related case, the Justice Department located emails in which Justice Department officials communicated with the FBI and wrote that they had communicated with the FBI. As a result, by letter dated August 10, 2017, from the FBI stated, “Upon further review, we subsequently determined potentially responsive documents may exist. As a result, your [FOIA] request has been reopened…”
(Surprisingly, the Trump Justice Department refuses to disclose the talking points developed by the Obama Justice Department to help it respond to press inquiries about the controversial June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.)
On June 27, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked private plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s email server, and mere hours before the Benghazi report was released publicly involving both Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting.
“The FBI is out of control. It is stunning that the FBI ‘found’ these Clinton-Lynch tarmac records only after we caught the agency hiding them in another lawsuit,” stated Judicial Watch Tom Fitton. “Judicial Watch will continue to press for answers about the FBI’s document games in court. In the meantime, the FBI should stop the stonewall and release these new records immediately.”
This case has also forced the FBI to release to the public the FBI’s Clinton investigative file, although more than half of the records remain withheld. The FBI has also told Judicial Watch that it anticipates completing the processing of these materials by July 2018.
There is significant controversy about whether the FBI and Obama Justice Department investigation gave Clinton and other witnesses and potential targets preferential treatment.
The Obama administration extended numerous immunity agreements, including: Clinton’s former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills; John Bentel, former director of the State Department’s Office of Information Resources Management; Heather Samuelson, Clinton’s executive assistant; Brian Pagliano, an IT employee at the State Department who serviced the Clinton non-government server; and an employee at Platt River Networks, the company that maintained it. It is not clear whether Hillary Clinton received some type of immunity.
In 2015, a political action committee run by McAuliffe, a close friend and political supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, donated nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe, wife of McCabe, who was then running for the Virginia State Senate. Also, the Virginia Democratic Party, over which McAuliffe had significant influence, donated an additional $207,788 to the Jill McCabe campaign. In July 2015, Andrew McCabe was in charge of the FBI’s Washington, DC, field office, which provided personnel resources to the Clinton email probe. Judicial Watch has several lawsuits about this McCabe/FBI/Clinton scandal.

http://dennismichaellynch.com/hillary-trump-causing-nuclear-arms-race-tough-north-korea-iran/,"Hillary: Trump is causing nuclear arms race, too tough on North Korea and Iran","Support our flag. Get the bumper sticker. CLICK HERE
Two-time failed presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton says rather than keeping the world secure in the face of unpredictable rogue states, Trump is actually encouraging a nuclear arms race in east Asia with his tough talk on North Korea and Iran.
Clinton said Trump’s recent threat to decertify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal “makes us look foolish and small and plays right into Iranian hands.”
“That is bad not just on the merits for this particular situation, but it sends a message across the globe that America’s word is not good,” said Clinton, who spoke in advance of Trump’s announcement Friday that he wants Congress and the other nations that negotiated the deal to toughen the requirements for Iran.
“This particular president is, I think, upending the kind of trust and credibility of the United States’ position and negotiation that is imperative to maintain.”
Trump hasn’t said a kind word about the 2015 nuclear deal, criticizing Obama and Clinton’s negotiating skills in coming up with it.
On Friday, Trump said Iran wasn’t “living up to the spirit of the deal”.
“We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said Friday, according to the Washington Times. “Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.”
Clinton predicts that Trump’s aggressive language toward North Korea only throws fuel on the fire of a nuclear arms race.
“We will now have an arms race — a nuclear arms race in East Asia,” Clinton predicted. “We will have the Japanese, who understandably are worried with missiles flying over them as the North Koreans have done, that they can’t count on America.”
She stressed a diplomatic approach.
“Diplomacy, preventing war, creating some deterrents is slow, hard-going, difficult work,” said Clinton, who declined to answer when asked whether Tillerson should resign. “And you can’t have impulsive people or ideological people who basically say, ‘Well, we’re done with you.'”
Today, I announced our strategy to confront the Iranian regime’s hostile actions and to ensure that they never acquire a nuclear weapon. pic.twitter.com/N4ISdjuEdC

http://dennismichaellynch.com/huma-abedin-still-clinton-payroll/,Huma Abedin still on Clinton payroll,"Despite Hillary Clinton’s blistering election defeat, Huma Abedin is still receiving a hefty salary from the failed candidate’s campaign to the tune of nearly $65,000, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Records show that Abedin, Clinton’s longtime friend and aide who served as the vice chair of the campaign, has been paid $64,415.10 in salary from Hillary for America, Clinton’s campaign committee, since mid-November.
From mid-November to the end of March, Abedin was paid $52,180.65 from Hillary for America. From the beginning of April until the end of June, Abedin was given another $12,234.45 from Clinton’s campaign committee.
And she’s not the only one to still be cashing in on Clinton’s campaign funds.
Nick Merrill, Hillary’s former press secretary, was still receiving checks from the campaign as of late June, the end point for the latest available figures.
Documents show that Robert Russo, who was the director of correspondence and briefing for the campaign, now carries the same job title in the Office of Hillary Clinton and he is still being compensated from Clinton’s campaign committee, as are a number of other staffers.
Clinton has also sent $800,000 from her campaign funds to Onward Together, a “resistance” group that she launched earlier this year.
In addition to that, Clinton’s political action group will reportedly fund a number of other “resistance” groups that have popped up since the conclusion of the election. Clinton is working with former aides and donors on the project.
“From the Women’s March to airports across the country where communities are welcoming immigrants and refugees to town hall meetings in every community, Americans are speaking out like never before,” Clinton wrote in an email to supporters in May. “I believe more fiercely than ever that citizen engagement at every level is central to a strong and vibrant democracy.”
“In some cases, we’ll provide direct funding to these organizations. For others, we’ll help amplify their work and do what we can to help them continue to grow their audiences and expand their reach.”
Clinton’s campaign reported sending the $800,000 check to Onward Together on May 1. The group was launched on May 15. It was the latest group Clinton had financed. She is already backing liberal activist groups Swing Left, Run for Something, and Emerge America.

http://dennismichaellynch.com/trump-launches-attack-comey-clinton/,"Trump launches attack against Comey, Clinton","Support our flag. Get the bumper sticker. CLICK HERE
Wednesday, on Twitter, President Trump launched an attack against former FBI director James Comey, saying he “totally protected Hillary Clinton” after the FBI confirmed their former head drafted a statement on the private email case against Clinton two months before it was over.
In a string of directed tweets, Trump also took swipes at the Justice Department, even suggesting they review what he called an evident “fix.”
“Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete,” Trump tweeted.
He then wrote: “Many people not interviewed, including Hillary Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this –obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?”
And he continued: “As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!”
The tweet storm was in reference to the FBI’s release of documents this week that prove Comey began penning a statement regarding the Clinton email investigation months before he interviewed the failed presidential candidate and other key witnesses. The document release was titled “Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”
The release may have confirmed critics’ claims that Comey was drafting an “exoneration statement” well before finalizing the case and recommending against criminal charges. The contents of the newly-released emails, however, were largely vague as the majority of the document was redacted. The records, now public, show the email, titled “Midyear Exam—UNCLASSIFIED,” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016, to FBI’s Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, general counsel James Baker, and chief of staff and senior counselor James Rybicki.
Trump’s tweets pose another challenge to the Justice Department regarding the matter.
Earlier this summer, Trump directed criticism toward the nation’s top law enforcement official, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While Trump has been at odds with one of his earliest supporters over the decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe, Trump in recent weeks has toned down that criticism.
The existence of the Comey documents was first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., after they reviewed transcripts with top Comey aides who hinted at the email’s existence.
The Judiciary Committee penned a letter on Aug. 30 to newly-appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray, noting their findings and saying, “It appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work. The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts.”
The documents raise questions about Comey’s June 2017 Senate testimony regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation.
Comey noted former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s involvement in the probe, including her controversial meeting with former President Bill Clinton days before his wife was interviewed. Last week, the FBI said it discovered 30 pages of documents related to that controversial 2016 tarmac meeting.
Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many..

http://dennismichaellynch.com/clinton-foundation-decides-keep-weinsteins-mega-donation/,Clinton Foundation decides to keep Weinstein’s mega donation,"Support our flag. Get the bumper sticker. CLICK HERE
The Clinton Foundation has decided to keep hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Hillary Clinton ally and disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is being accused of sexual harassment and rape.
The foundation claims the donations, ranging from $100,000 to $250,000, are already being spent on projects.
Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, announced the move to keep the money via Twitter. “Suggesting @ClintonFdn return funds from our 330,000+ donors ignores the fact that donations have been used to help people across the world,” Minassian tweeted.
Dozens of Democratic Party politicians, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Sen. Al Franken, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Cory Booker have promised to donate their contributions from Weinstein to charities focused on women’s rights, following accusations from multiple actresses that have come forward and accused the Hollywood executive of sexual assault and rape.
Hillary Clinton, who has been a close companion of Weinstein’s over the past couple of years, followed similar rhetoric to that of her former colleagues, claiming she was “shocked and appalled” after the sexual harassment allegations were revealed about him. The mogul hosted fundraisers for Clinton in the past and donated more than $46,000 to her recent presidential campaign.
“What other people are saying, what my former colleagues are saying, is they’re going to donate it to charity, and of course I will do that,” she said on CNN. “I give 10% of my income to charity every year, this will be part of that. There’s no – there’s no doubt about it.”
Suggesting @ClintonFdn return funds from our 330,000+ donors ignores the fact that donations have been used to help people across the world. https://t.co/dBXNZwAkWS

Twice failed presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton called President Donald J. Trump an admitted “sexual assaulter” during an interview with BBC’s Andrew Marr published on Friday (see below).
Clinton was discussing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was recently accused of sexual abuse and rape after multiple women and former co-workers stepped forward with stories of incidents.
Clinton said she was “shocked and appalled” by the stories of Weinstein’s abuses, and clarified that he was a political acquaintance who had donated to many candidates in the Democratic Party before naming others associated with the movie mogul.
“This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it’s in entertainment [or] politics,” Clinton said, before leveling an allegation against President Trump.
“After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office. There has to be a recognition that we must stand against the kind of action that is so sexist and misogynistic,” she said.
Clinton’s remarks seem to be referring to a 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape, released during the 2016 presidential campaign, in which Donald Trump made lewd remarks that indicated he could touch women in private areas because he was famous
The president said it was “locker room banter.” He also said, “Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.”
During the interview, Marr brought former President Bill Clinton up, as well, calling Clinton out for discounting sexual-assault accusations against her husband, including the three women President Trump brought out on stage during the 2016 campaign. Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, and Paula Jones all sat in the audience last October in St. Louis, Missouri.
According to the Washington Times:
Juanita Broaddrick insists Mr. Clinton raped her in 1978 when she was 35 years old.
Kathleen Willey claims Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted her in November 1993 while she was a former White House aide.
Paula Jones filed a lawsuit against Mr. Clinton for sexual harassment in 1994. An $850,000 out-of-court settlement was reached in 1998.
“In your book,” Marr said to the former secretary of state, “the three women brought on stage by Trump, attacking your husband, you kind of dismiss them. Was that the right thing to do? Are you sure about that?”
“Well, yes,” Clinton answered, “because that had all been litigated.”
Clinton drew the line at saying President Trump and Weinstein are the “same kind of person,” but went on to say they both had similar reports against them.
She also denigrated the president’s treatment of women, including allegations that he behaves in a “sexist, if not misogynistic” way towards them.

Kudos to this patriot who keeps that state’s highway department on their game….
The Associated Press reports, a sign marking the Crooked Hill Road exit off a suburban New York parkway has been altered to read “Crooked Hillary.”
A sign marking the Crooked Hill Road exit on the Sagtikos Parkway was defaced to “Crooked Hillary,” officials said https://t.co/7KBwLtEuWt pic.twitter.com/JwX2lEIRKq
— Newsday (@Newsday) June 15, 2017
Newsday reports the defaced green traffic sign on the Sagtikos Parkway on Long Island was reported to the state Department of Transportation on Wednesday.
A DOT spokesman says the sign has been removed and “defacing public signs is illegal.”
If The TRUE Fits
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump often used the moniker “Crooked Hillary” when referring to Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, who at the time suffered from the mistrust of many voters.
Trump won the election and in a recent tweet said “Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate.” Clinton tweeted back “People in covfefe houses shouldn’t throw covfefe,” a dig at Trump for tweeting the mystifying nonword.
In a related story…
Syracuse.com reports, President-elect Donald Trump’s Silicon Valley summit Wednesday was missing one tech company he’s been a big fan of: Twitter.
Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (Google) CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla’s Elon Musk and other big names at Trump Tower in New York. However, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey wasn’t invited.
Trump used Twitter frequently throughout his campaign to criticize his opponents and, since his election, share updates on his cabinet appointments instead of formal news conferences. “Saturday Night Live” recently mocked his tweeting obsession with a skit starring Alec Baldwin and Trump responded by tweeting — of course — that “SNL” is “unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny” and “sad.”
Twitter Bitter
Politico reports Twitter was most likely “bounced” from Trump’s meeting because the social media company refused to allow a #CrookedHillary emoji. Trump frequently referred to Hillary Clinton as “crooked,” and used the hashtag during the White House race.
According to Variety, the emoji would have been a picture of a hand holding a bag of money or a stick figure running with a bag of money, referencing accusations about the Democratic candidate’s Clinton Foundation. Trump’s campaign reportedly committed $5 million to spending on Twitter ads, but it’s unclear if that amount would have included the custom emoji.
Sean Spicer, communications director for the Republican National Committee, told the Associated Press that the 140-character brand wasn’t snubbed for retribution: “The conference table was only so big, OK?”
Size Matters
Another spokesperson told Reuters that Twitter wasn’t invited “because they aren’t big enough.” Twitter’s market capitalization is $13.85 billion, well behind Facebook and Amazon; the smallest company in Wednesday’s meeting was Tesla at $31.92 billion.
Trump told the companies at the meeting, organized by Facebook board member Peter Thiel, that he wanted to support them and encourage tech growth in the U.S.
“We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. Anything we can do to help this go on, we will be there for you,” Trump said. “You’ll call my people, you’ll call me. We have no formal chain of command around here.”
Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, which Trump frequently criticized for coverage during the election, told the AP the meeting was “very productive” and said he “shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars.”",hillary

Trump explained to a crowd in Colorado the great pains Clinton took to erase emails from her unauthorized homebrew server after being subpoenaed by Congress because he said she was trying to hide criminal activity.
“However, I think some of these 33,000 were captured yesterday,”
Trump said, referring to the news that former FBI Director James Comey was revisiting the Clinton investigation because of emails it discovered in a separate case.
The FBI discovered about 1,000 emails related to the Clinton probe during an investigation of a separate case involving her chief of staff Huma Abedin.
A laptop that Abedin shared with her husband, disgraced former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, was confiscated by the FBI while it was investigating Weiner’s involvement in a sexting scandal.

http://www.cscmediagroupus.com/matthew-deperi/justice-department-hillary-plea-deal,REPORT: Justice Department Has Offered Hillary Clinton A Plea Deal,"Here’s something you won’t be seeing reported by major news networks. The Justice Department has reportedly reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information. Clinton, who used her private email server while she was Secretary of State under Obama has been given an opportunity to plead guilty to breaking the law in exchange for a plea bargain.
Last month a high-ranking Justice Department official discussed giving Hillary a plea bargain to her lawyer. It appears that offer is back on the table.
During the exploratory talks with the prosecutor, the Clinton attorney was told that despite former FBI Director James Comey’s decision last July not to prosecute Hillary. The Justice Department has reexamined the email case and believes there are ample grounds for prosecuting Hillary on a number of counts.
Under the Justice Department’s plea offer, Hillary would be required to sign a document admitting that she committed a prosecutable crime. In return, the DOJ would agree not to bring charges against Hillary in connection with the email probe.
Also as part of the agreement, the Justice Department would not proceed with an investigation of Hillary’s pay to play deals with foreign governments and businessmen who contributed to the Clinton Foundation or who paid Bill Clinton exorbitant speaking fees.
The Clinton attorney cautioned that normally a plea is offered by a prosecutor only upon arraignment, and Hillary has not yet been charged with any crime.
At this time it is unclear whether Hillary will take the deal offered by the Justice Department. Currently, no official charges have been filed against Hillary. It is safe to assume the Clinton camp is assessing whether there is a concrete case against her. Judging from this report it is clear that Hillary is still not out of the woods.",hillary

To anyone who had spent more than five minutes looking at the events of 9/11 it was clear that the 9/11 Commission Report was an absolute sham and that the true culprits of 9/11 were left unpunished.
For that reason, many Trump cult believers were thrilled when prior to the (s)election, Trump said, ""You will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center. It wasn't the Iraqis. You may find it's the Saudis.""
He went on to say, ""They have papers in there that are very secret,"" referencing the 28 classified pages of the 9/11 commission report, ""But you will find out.""
And Trump was right, the 28 pages were released and implicated the Saudi government in 9/11.
Many Trump followers were thrilled when he won, saying that unlike Killary, Trump will not attack Syria and get the US embroiled in World War III, won’t do shady arms deals in exchange for bribes and will re-investigate 9/11 and Saudi Arabia’s involvement!
Then he was elected, bombed Syria, has gotten the US nearly into World War III with both Russia and China and in the last week he sold the Saudi King $360 billion worth of arms in exchange for a pledge to donate to his daughter Ivanka’s trust for female entrepreneurs and also discussed dropping the lawsuit against Saudi Arabia for 9/11.
So, he did everything Killary would have done. Well, at least he didn’t bow to the Saudi King like that cuck Obama.",hillary

Clinton said that while she won most of the minority vote during the 2016 election, she could have done a better job at reassuring the fears of white voters and women while talking with an Economists podcast Tuesday.
“Forget about the white men’s vote! But I think I myself could have perhaps done a better job in reaching out and reassuring women and white voters in general, and I think I was on my way to winning as I say in the book, until Jim Comey’s letter, aided and abetted by the Russian WikiLeaks information weaponisation,” Clinton told The Economist Asks.
Trump won the majority of white evangelical voters, while Clinton suffered in gaining votes from white women and women who didn’t have a college education.
“Preliminary exit poll results show that while she won women by 12 points overall (Trump won men by the same margin, a historic gender gap),1 Clinton lost the votes of white women overall and struggled to win women voters without a college education in states that could have propelled her to victory,” Five Thirty Eight noted after the election.
Clinton also said she didn’t blame white voters for being wary of voting for her after former FBI Director James Comey announced another investigation into her emails.
“So I don’t blame voters for feeling like okay, it’s okay to vote for me, but then having something interrupt that thought process and their decision being put on hold and eventually going against me,” Clinton added.

News broke Tuesday that the FBI allegedly buried evidence tying the Clinton Foundation to a Russian bribery scheme related to U.S. uranium reserves. According to reports, the FBI had evidence dating back as early as 2009 that indicated Russian nuclear officials were giving kickbacks to the Clinton Foundation while then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that approved a uranium deal with a state-owned Russian company. (REPORT: FBI Sat On Evidence Tying The Clintons To A Russian Bribery Scheme)
The story was apparently too unimportant to be covered by the “big three” broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, as they all refused to spend airtime on it Tuesday. The Media Research Center notes that over the course of two years, those networks have only given three minutes to the Clinton Foundation’s ties to Russia.",hillary
http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/17/report-fbi-sat-on-evidence-tying-the-clintons-to-a-russians-bribery-scheme/,BREAKING: FBI buried evidence of Russian collusion — WITH THE CLINTONS…,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reportedly buried evidence tying the Clinton Foundation to a Russian bribery scheme underway as the Obama administration decided whether or not to give Moscow control over U.S. uranium reserves.
FBI officials collected evidence of a Russian bribery scheme that started as early as 2009, including “an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow,” The Hill reported Tuesday.
WATCH:
The Clinton Foundation became a lightning rod for controversy during the 2016 election. Critics, including President Donald Trump, claimed the Clinton Foundation was engaged in influence peddling — trading donations for political favors. the Clintons repeatedly denied these allegations.
On the campaign trail, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended her role in approving Rosatom’s, Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy company, acquisition of Canadian mining company Uranium One.
Clinton said there was no reason at the time to oppose the Uranium One deal, and argued the committee she served on had no veto power to stop the deal — they only gave the president a recommendation.
But The Hill found documents showing investigators “had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.”
“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns,” a source who worked on the case told The Hill.
“And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” the source said.
Rosatom began its Uranium One takeover in 2009, and U.S. officials approved the Uranium One take over in October 2010. The takeover gave Russia control over 20 percent of U.S. uranium reserves.
The merger lasted through 2013, and during that time donations from the charitable foundation of Uranium One’s chairman donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation.
Former President Bill Clinton also got $500,000 for a speech he gave in Moscow shortly after Rosatom announced its plans to take control of the Canadian mining company. Clinton was paid by a “Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock,” The New York Times reported in 2015.
Mikerin was sentenced 48 months in prison and fined more than $2.1 million in late 2015, but the Justice Department’s release on the court case totally omitted any evidence about “Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons,” The Hill found, despite evidence of “the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation.”

“Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete,” Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday. “Many.. …people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?” Trump wrote in a successive tweets.

Newsweek first reported the release of FBI documents that included an email from Comey sent May 2, 2016, to FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, general council James Baker, chief of staff James Rybicki.
In the email, which is marked unclassified but is redacted in the FBI’s release, Comey lays out what would become his July 5, 2016, speech. During his remarks, he claimed the FBI found wrongdoing in Clinton’s decision to host State Department emails on a private server, but he did not recommend that the Department of Justice bring charges.
The FBI interviewed Clinton on July 2, 2016, just days before Comey’s statement.
“As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!,” Trump said in a later tweet.

http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/17/former-hillary-clinton-strategist-refutes-claims-that-100000-had-huge-impact-on-election/,"Former Hillary Clinton Strategist Refutes Claims That $100,000 Had Huge Impact On Election","Mark Penn, the former chief strategist for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, said Tuesday that $100,000 worth of Russian ads on Facebook certainly did not sway the 2016 presidential election.
Appearing on a segment for Fox News, Penn, who also was a chief strategist for Bill Clinton’s 1996 presidential campaign, listed a number of reasons why the ads likely had a minuscule impact on the political contest.
“Fifty-six percent were after the election … most of them were not to the swing states … [and] most of them didn’t mention candidates,” he said on Fox & Friends.
“It really is interesting when you look at the numbers … her [Clinton’s] budget you said was $2.4 billion, and Russia spent $100,000,” one of the hosts said.
WATCH:
Penn also wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, which was published Sunday and titled “You Can’t Buy The Presidency for $100,000.”
“The fake news about fake news is practically endless. Americans worried about Russia’s influence in the 2016 election have seized on a handful of Facebook ads as though there weren’t also three 90-minute debates, two televised party conventions, and $2.4 billion spent on last year’s campaign,” Penn opened in the opinion piece. “The danger is that bending facts to fit the Russia story line may nudge Washington into needlessly and recklessly regulating the internet and curtailing basic freedoms.”
Richard Bennett, one of the original creators of the WiFi system and a tech consultant, agrees.
“For all its the emotional appeal, the idea that Russia was able to change the outcome of the presidential election with a $100,000 Facebook ad buy is absurd. If it were true, then every political consultant in the U.S. would be out of a job,” Bennett told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Hillary and her supporters spent lots of money on social media campaigns, just not as wisely as the Trump campaign. The election turned out the way it did because Hillary not only failed to win the white working class vote, she didn’t even bother to ask for it. Voters don’t like being disrespected.”
While the amount of ads was very meager relative to the larger, massive political advertisement ecosystem, it’s still worrisome to lawmakers who fear Russian companies that may have connections to the Kremlin both were and are trying to cultivate an even further schismatic political landscape in America.
And due to these concerns from both the public and elected officials that Russia interfered with the election, even helping Trump win, Facebook later handed over the relevant evidence to congressional investigators, including special counsel Robert Mueller who is investigating the claims of Russian interference.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised during a Facebook Live broadcast to protect “election integrity.” He later expressed atonement during the closing hours of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur for other people using the platform “to divide people.” The entrepreneurial wunderkind also apologized for once calling fake news’ impact on the election a “pretty crazy” idea, while also conversely defending his company on several occasions.

WATCH:
During a Tuesday interview, Caldwell accused Hillary Clinton of being hypocritical for supporting the NFL protests because her and her husband were instrumental in implementing the very things that the players are protesting.
Caldwell pointed specifically to the 1994 crime bill, which he says “led to the over-criminalization of African Americans.”
“Hillary Rodham Clinton is responsible for advocating for modern-day slavery, and I’ll tell you why,” Caldwell said. “The ’94 crime bill led to the three-strike rule. It also took funding for education and training out of the prison system which led to a recidivism rate of 75 percent after five years.”
“So when we think about the issues that players and others are protesting — oppression, systematic racism, which does exist in America — we can thank the Clintons for their role in that,” he concluded.

Sessions justified the firing of Director Comey during his testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and asserted that the errors Comey made in the Clinton case were far more devastating than people realize.
“Sen. [Dianne] Feinstein, I don’t think it’s been fully understood the significance of the error that Mr. Comey made on the Clinton matter,” Sessions said. “I don’t think I’ve heard of a situation in which a major case in which Department of Justice prosecutors were involved in an investigation that the investigative agency announces the closure of the investigation.”
“And then a few weeks before this happened, he was testifying before the Congress … and he said he thought he did the right thing and would do it again,” Sessions recalled. “So the Deputy Attorney General [Rod] Rosenstein … said that was a usurpation of the position of the Department of Justice.”
“Particularly, we were concerned that he had reaffirmed that he would do it again,” he declared. “I think that was a basis call that we needed a fresh start at the FBI.”

“I think there a lot more connections that have yet to come to light,” Clinton told an audience in London on Sunday, BuzzFeed News reported. “If I had been elected I would have called for an independent commission to get to the bottom of it.”
Clinton proceeded to compare her election loss to the 9/11 attacks, citing “intelligence veterans.”
“We had really well-respected security, intelligence veterans saying this was a 'cyber 9/11' in the sense it was a direct attack on our institutions,” she said. “That may sound dramatic but we know that they probed and tried to intrude into election systems — not just the social media propaganda part of their campaign.”
Clinton, who is on a tour promoting her book, What Happened, made repeated statements blaming Russia for her election loss.
According to a report from the Daily Mail, Bill Clinton reportedly threw her book in the trash after the two argued about the content of the book before it went to publishing:
He told her the book made her look bewildered, angry and confused, and that those were poor qualities in a person who aspired to be a world leader.
He hated the title because calling it ""What Happened"" would only make people say, ""You lost.""
He urged her to postpone the pub date and rewrite the book, but she yelled at him and said: ""The book is finished and that’s how it’s going to be published.""
Clinton made headlines Monday after having a health-related emergency during her U.K. tour. She missed a few media appearances due to having fallen and broken her toe. She claimed afterward that she was ""running down the stairs in heels with a cup of coffee in hand, I was talking over my shoulder and my heel caught and I fell backwards.""",hillary

Hillary: I Had No Idea About Weinstein.,"Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the creator of Designing Women and a Clinton confidant who helped write Bill Clinton's apology to the nation for his sexual misconduct, revealed in an op-ed for The Hollywood Reporter Wednesday that she had warned multiple ""top-level Democratic operatives"" about Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual behavior, but her warnings ""fell on deaf ears."" Bloodworth-Thomason's statement is yet more evidence that more people in the political world knew more about Weinstein's actions than they're willing to admit.
""As more and more women have come forward, A-listers who are normally intrepid, social injustice sniffers have scrambled to condemn Weinstein and announce that they had no idea all this was going on,"" writes Bloodworth-Thomason. ""Some said this despite knowing him for decades, starring in his films and being friends with accusers who starred in his films. OK. Whatever. I, myself, was a member of a 'Let's Bring Harvey Weinstein Down' lunch club, and I don't even work in features.""
After suggesting that the open secret about Weinstein was indeed broadly covered up, she admits that ""clearly delineated moral choices can still be painfully complex where friendship is involved."" Case in point: her friendship with Bill Clinton, whom she helped write his infamous ""sexual misconduct"" apology.
""One of the best friends I will ever have and a man I love dearly, former President Bill Clinton, has certainly taxed my feminist conscience, but always without diminishing my affection,"" she says. ""I even helped write his apology to the nation for his own sexual misconduct, was sitting next to him when he delivered it, and believe to this day it was based on something that was none of our business.""
While some may view it as hypocritical, she says, despite defending Clinton, she has sounded the alarm on Weinstein in the past, specifically to three unnamed ""top-level Democratic operatives.""

""And yes, some may call it hypocritical, but I confess to having had no problem warning at least three top-level Democratic operatives against allowing Harvey Weinstein to host political fundraisers,"" she writes. ""A warning that evidently (and to the glee of Fox News) fell on deaf ears.""
Though it took a few days amid mounting public pressure, Hillary Clinton condemned Harvey Weinstein last week for his alleged chronic sexual harassing and assaulting. Clinton said she was ""shocked"" and ""appalled"" by the allegations and assured CNN that she had never looked the other way about Hollywood's biggest open secret.
""I was just sick. I was shocked. I was appalled,"" Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria last Wednesday. ""It was something that was just intolerable in every way. Like so many people who have come forward and spoken out, this was a different side to a person that I and many others had known in the past.""
""People in Democratic politics for many decades appreciated his help and support,"" said Clinton. When Zakaria asked if Weinstein had gotten away with his behavior for so long because people had looked the other way, Clinton responded, ""Well, I certainly didn’t and I don’t know who did.""
Several reports over the last week have focused on the Clintons' cozy relationship with Weinstein, including a flashback to a 1998 Washington Post article revealing that Weinstein had donated $10,000 to Bill Clinton's legal defense fund for the Lewinsky case.",hillary
http://www.dailywire.com/news/22381/report-fbi-hid-evidence-tying-clintons-russian-ryan-saavedra,REPORT: FBI Hid Evidence Tying The Clintons To A Russian Bribery Scheme,"Before the Obama administration approved a highly controversial deal in 2010 giving Russia control of approximately 20% of U.S. uranium, the FBI had collected a significant amount of evidence which showed that Russian officials were engaged in a massive bribery scheme aimed at growing their atomic energy business inside the United States.
According to a Tuesday report from The Hill, the FBI started gathering evidence in 2009 of Russian officials engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering:
Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.
They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.
Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.
The first decision came when the State Department and other government agencies approved the sale of the Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom in October 2010, which gave the Russians control of a significant portion of U.S. uranium. In 2011, the Obama administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants – a significant move as it allowed Tenex to expand its sales which were heavily restricted under the Megatons to Megawatts peace program from the 1990s.
“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns,” a source who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials. “And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions.”
The evidence collected by the FBI directly contradicts prior statements by the Obama administration and the Clintons about the Uranium One deal.
The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.
But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.
Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.
After the Uranium One deal was approved, Uranium One’s chairman donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton also appears to have benefited financially as he received $500,000 for a speech he gave in Moscow shortly after Rosatom made the announcement that they were taking control of Uranium One.",hillary
http://www.dailywire.com/news/22398/report-robert-mueller-was-fbi-director-when-agency-ryan-saavedra,REPORT: Robert Mueller Was FBI Director When Agency Hid Evidence On Clinton-Russia Connection,"Robert Mueller, who is the special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation, oversaw the FBI when the agency allegedly hid evidence it had collected that showed that Russian officials were engaged in a bribery scheme aimed at growing their atomic energy business inside the United States.
The details were outlined in a report on Tuesday which showed that the evidence was withheld even from lawmakers as they questioned the Obama administration’s approval of the sale of Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom, which led to Russia controlling 20 percent of U.S. uranium.
Former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he was never made aware of anything regarding “Russian nuclear corruption” though many of his fellow lawmakers were concerned about the deal, which was also approved by Hillary Clinton’s State Department.
“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” Rogers said. “The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”
According to The Hill, there are strong ties between the high-level officials who were involved in the allegedly undisclosed investigation on the Russian bribery scheme and the current investigation into whether Trump campaign officials ""colluded"" with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign:
The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.
Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.
The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired earlier this year.
Mueller has come under fire after it was revealed that the attorneys on his staff made previous political donations to the Democratic Party, including to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while making none to then-candidate Donald Trump.",hillary
http://www.dailywire.com/news/22339/harvard-prof-dreams-scenario-which-hillary-becomes-hank-berrien,Harvard Prof Dreams Up Scenario In Which Hillary Becomes President,"Remember Teddy Kennedy of Chappaquiddick fame intoning at the 1980 Democratic Convention after he had conceded the nomination to incumbent President Jimmy Carter, “The work goes on; the cause endures; the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die”?
Nothing much has changed for hard-core Democrats, who are still busily scripting scenarios in which they can wrest the presidency from President Trump and install Hillary Clinton as president.
The latest case in point comes from Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig, who made a brief abortive effort at gaining the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Lessig, writing at medium.com, posits that if proof positive were to emerge that Trump conspired with a foreign government to get elected, then “the first step is obvious. Trump should resign or, if he doesn’t, he should be impeached.”
Lessig then takes another step in his odyssey: “The second step should be obvious as well: Pence should resign or, if he doesn’t, he should be impeached. He benefited from the criminal (and treasonous) conspiracy just as much as Trump. He shouldn’t benefit even more by becoming the residual President.”
With two notches on his gun, Lessig aims for a third: “Under the law as it is, this leaves Paul Ryan as President. And the hard moral question that Ryan would then face is whether he should remain as President. By hypothesis, we’re assuming the office was effectively stolen from the legitimate winner by a criminal and treasonous act of the (previous) leader of Ryan’s own party. Ryan’s being President is just the fruit of that poisonous tree. So should he just ignore that? Or should he acknowledge the wrong, and act to make it right?”

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is completely destroyed by the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who hacks the Church's foundations down to bedrock.
And just how should Ryan “make it right?”
Think reallllllllyyyy hard ….
Noting “there’s no mechanism in American law for a new election,” Lessig jumps to this:
President Ryan would have the right to nominate a Vice-President … If Ryan became President because the Trump/Pence campaign committed treason, who should he nominate as his Vice President? The answer seems unavoidable: He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party, and then step aside, and let her become the President.
Bingo. Hillary!
Lessig wouldn’t want to rush anything, of course: “Of course, this is the sort of thing that’s unimaginable in Washington today. But that’s why we need to start imagining it, now. The nation won’t have months to deliberate the matter in the urgency of a treason-driven impeachment. It’s the sort of truth we should have resolved to long before it is needed.”
Continuing his phantasmical journey, Lessig imagines an All-Forgiving Hillary Clinton: “ … if he did it, then Clinton should embrace the spirit of cross partisan decency and nominate Ryan, or a Republican, as her Vice President.”
Whatever he’s smoking, there should be laws against it.
Lessig concludes, “We should try at least to work through what should happen if the unthinkable happens. Because when it happens, we won’t have much time to think.”
Then again, this kind of speculative reverie is what happens when you have too much time to think.

http://www.dailywire.com/news/22438/hillary-clinton-finally-reassures-america-she-wont-emily-zanotti,Hillary Clinton FINALLY Reassures America That She Won't Run For President Again,"Hillary Clinton says she much prefers being Donald Trump's ""shadow President,"" and claims that, despite mulling it over in the wake of her 2016 election loss, she definitely, most certainly, absolutely will not run for President for a third time.
Probably.
Speaking to BBC Radio, Clinton dispelled rumors that she'd be willing to take a second go at President Donald Trump, even though he said earlier this week that he'd ""love"" to see her challenge him in the mid-term elections.
""No, I'm not going to run again,"" she said.
She continued, ""I think I'm in a position where my voice will actually be magnified because I am not running (for office), and there's a very good basis, as we watch Trump's support shrink, that people will say, 'Well, what she said was right and now where do we go from here?'""
The unfortunate problem for Hillary is, of course, that her ""voice"" is in the wilderness, much like she was for weeks following her loss to Donald Trump. She can ""speak out"" on social media, or deliver stinging remarks in foreign countries as Trump negotiates the realities of day-to-day life as Commander-in-Chief, but her advice and counsel doesn't matter much to a president who derives sadistic pleasure from reminding her that she's on the outside looking in.
Clinton has ramped up her criticism in recent weeks, after her disastrous What Happened book tour left fellow Democrats puzzled at her long-term value to the party. After all, her tome featured no good ideas on how to improve data collection, or admissions that she failed to pay attention to flyover country in a way that would have allowed her to message to out-of-work Rust Belters correctly; just deep, and self-consoling admissions that, despite her best efforts, everyone around her failed to make her president.

The so-called ""Resistance"" has also more or less abandoned their former presidential candidate. What passes for organized anti-Trumpism is mostly Soros-funded and populated by older, retired women who consider posting angry screeds and Occupy Democrats memes on Facebook a form of political activism. The Women's March, which should have embraced their fallen hero with gusto, invited, instead, her Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders to give a commencement address at their first annual gathering in Detroit.
But nevertheless, Clinton persists.
""I'm trying to make the case about what we need to do so that what happened in my election doesn't happen again,"" she told the BBC. ""But I'll also be raising money and support for candidates and causes I believe in. And I'll be supporting the Democratic Party in the elections this year, next year and 2020.""
She rounded out her interview by insisting, yet again, that it's nearly impossible she failed to win office. ""I thought I was going to win, I thought I'd have the awesome responsibility and great honor of being the first woman president,"" she said. ""I had worked on a speech celebrating a victory. … And it all came crashing down,""

The FBI turned over the documents after Judicial Watch sued the State Department for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request.
""This is a disturbing development,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a press release Tuesday, which is pushing for the public release of the emails. ""Our experience with Abedin's emails suggest these Weiner laptop documents will include classified and other sensitive materials.""
The watchdog group asked for ""All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013,"" using a non-'state.gov' email address, the Daily Mail reports.
But their public release will take a while.
In a joint status report signed off by Judicial Watch and the State Department, and dated last week, the State Department names the number of documents found on Weiner's computer – 2,800 – and says it plans to have it review of those documents completed by December 31, 2017.
""Based on a preliminary review, the State Department expects that a significant portion of these documents may be duplicative of material already reviewed and processed,"" the court document reads.
Fitton thinks both Clinton and Abedin committed crimes. Clinton was secretary of state and Abedin served as Clinton's deputy chief of staff, both while using a private email server to conduct government business. Clinton destroyed tens of thousands of emails and smashed the hard drives.
""When will the Justice Department do a serious investigation of Hillary Clinton's and Huma Abedin's obvious violations of law?"" Fitton said.
Last month, Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison for a sex case involving a 15-year-old girl. On the day Weiner pleaded guilty, Abedin announced the couple was separating.",hillary

From Breitbart:
“According to recent reports at Fox, Republican Party leaders have a secret plan to win the mere terms,” the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host said. “Instead of telling voters what they would do, they’ve decided to run against Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic nominee. It worked last time. The idea is that it will work again. The appeal is obvious. No one likes Hillary Clinton, even people who are paid to pretend they like her. The downside is, it’s not really a relevant argument. Hillary Clinton does not run anything anymore. She does not represent the modern Democratic Party.”
“They’ve moved on to another planet, and that’s the point,” he continued. “Democratic Party leaders are saying things far more extreme than anything the midwestern Methodist like Hillary Clinton ever would have said or thought. They have become openly bigoted for example, blaming an entire ethnic group for the country’s problems. They have called for eliminating our country’s borders, the right to self-defense, even the distinction between male and female. They are at war with nature and with common sense. And by the way, they are agitating for an actual war against Russia. They are insane. Some of them are dangerous. Somebody ought to run against them, not against the ghost of some elderly retired nominee from the last cycle. Yet somehow, the Republicans in Congress say they are not going to do that. Are they?”
Carlson followed up the monologue with an interview with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the co-chair of the House Freedom Caucus and reiterated his skepticism of running against Clinton this November.
“I don’t want to pooh-pooh the idea of running against Hillary,” he said. “I love doing Hillary segments. They are hilarious. They are a little mean, but it’s fun. But the Democratic Party of right now is not the party of Hillary Clinton. It’s an openly extremist, racist party, I would argue. And, I think it’s obvious that Republicans in opposition should run against them.”
All Tucker left out was their open advocacy for Big Tech’s censoring of the internet.
The Democrats modern platform is one of racial hate, mass censorship, open borders, civilian disarmament and politically correct thought policing, yet the Republicans could actually lose because they’re going to run on “tax cuts,” “moving our embassy to Jerusalem” and Hillary Clinton.",hillary

http://www.dcclothesline.com/2018/04/27/john-brennans-cia-operated-like-a-branch-office-of-the-hillary-campaign/,John Brennan’s CIA ‘Operated Like A Branch Office Of The Hillary Campaign’,"Investigators have been focusing primarily on the roles of the DOJ and the FBI in the framing of President Trump for colluding with the Russians. But, the word is, that it all started with John Brennan, Obama’s CIA Director.
Not that Brennan had just cause to believe that Trump had done anything unlawful, but he is said to harbor intense hatred toward him. George Neumayr of the Spectator, calls it “the probe from nowhere to nowhere, undertaken simply to satisfy the partisan hunches of John Brennan and other Trump haters in the Obama administration.”
Neumayr says that, based upon Brennan’s testimony and his leaks, he started pushing the FBI to open an investigation in the spring of 2016. He would present the FBI with what he called evidence. Neumayr says that Brennan would “shake down” foreign intelligence officials looking for anything to hang on Trump. He would present the information to Peter Strzok and other government officials. Strzok, much as he hated Trump, famously told his paramour, Lisa Page, that there’s no “there, there.”
In fact, the original source of the “intelligence” that Brennan was receiving was British spy Christopher Steele. Neumayr explains:
Brennan’s alleged intelligence from the British on Trump-Russia collusion was just laundered Steele opposition research for Hillary (Steele had been feeding his work to British spies, who contacted Brennan). At the center of almost all the streams of phony intelligence flowing into the FBI was Steele. Through his relationship with the FBI, he served as a direct stream of bad intelligence. Through foreign intelligence agencies, he became an indirect stream of bad intelligence (with anything he gave those agencies re-routed to the FBI through Brennan). He also served as a conduit for opposition research from Hillary partisans at or connected to the State Department (Cody Shearer, a Hillary hatchet man, passed his opposition research through John Kerry aide Jonathan Winer to Steele, who then fed it back to the FBI).
This is similar to the FBI’s use of reporter Michael Isikoff’s Yahoo News article to corroborate Christopher Steele’s dossier when, in fact, Steele was the source of Isikoff’s story.
Brennan leaked news of his “probe” to then-Senator Harry Reid, who told reporters that “Brennan had an “ulterior motive” in leaking the existence of the probe to him. The very thought of Donald Trump as president made Brennan see red and caused him to lose all judgment.”
The FBI knew they could not start an investigation based on the rubbish that Brennan was presenting to them. They needed to find a reason. When Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer, had drinks in a London bar with low-level Trump advisor George Papadopoulos, who told Downer that he had been approached by a Russian who offered to provide “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, that became a talking point for the FBI. However, according to Devin Nunes, that incident was not mentioned in the Electronic Communication (EC) that originated the counterintelligence investigation.
Nunes and several other Congressmen were allowed to view the document after threatening contempt of Congress charges and possible impeachment votes. The DOJ and the FBI went to great lengths to keep the American people from learning that there was no original intelligence to support the case for collusion. None.
So, now we have Obama’s DOJ, FBI and CIA, and it looks like they had a little help from the State Department, all colluding to influence the outcome of a presidential election. It’s hardly a stretch of the imagination to believe that Obama knew what was happening.
Perhaps, with former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe now likely to face criminal charges, and not feeling much love or loyalty for his former boss, James Comey, it’s possible he might be open to a deal.
When the IG’s report is released next month, others may be incriminated offering new opportunities for deals. James Comey, who is currently under investigation by the IG for leaking classified documents, may find himself in legal jeopardy.
The list of those who may face charges is long. It might include then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, then-Director of National Intelligence, Samantha Powers, then-US Ambassador to the United Nations and others.
Devin Nunes has confirmed that the House Intelligence Committee is now investigating the role of the Obama State Department.
It’s possible that Strzok and Page may already be cooperating with the IG. Unrelated, Congressional committees are expecting to receive new text message exchanges between the pair on Thursday.
Additionally, Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch reported that his organization received a new batch of emails recovered from Hillary Clinton’s private server, ten of which were classified. They were so highly classified that the entire bodies of several of them were completely redacted. One was addressed to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair with “Mideast Peace” in the subject line. The rest of the email was redacted. Another was entirely redacted; even the address line, and the subject line simply said “Plan.” No wonder Hillary tried to destroy these. Let’s hope that some of the rest of those 32,000 emails are recoverable. Please see video below for an interesting discussion.
The IG report itself, as did their report on Andrew McCabe, will undoubtedly provide some new evidence. And we hope that Trump will exercise his presidential power and demand that the DOJ immediately turn over all of the subpoenaed documents. I don’t understand his hesitation so far.
This is the hangover from the Obama era. America’s most influential institutions were politicized and were used to do Obama’s – and Hillary Clinton’s – bidding. Officials at the highest levels of the DOJ, the FBI, the CIA and possibly the State Department, abused their powers to fabricate a case against Donald Trump because they wanted to marginalize him. Unfortunately for them, Hillary lost the race and America is slowly learning the truth.

Finally, after years of cover-ups, the participants in the Clinton criminal cartel may be facing indictment and imprisonment. Earlier this week, lawmakers joined forces to send a criminal referral to the Dept. of Justice that recommends criminal investigations into James Comey, Loretta Lynch, Hillary Clinton, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe, all “swamp creatures” who have committed outrageous criminal acts against the people of America.
As Newstarget.com reports, these co-conspirators are being referred for criminal investigations due to:
1) lying about intelligence in order to spy on the 2016 Trump campaign; and 2) intentionally botching the probe into Clinton’s criminal mishandling of classified data via an unsecured private server.
See the criminal referral letter at this House.gov link.
Also, as reported on JamesComey.news, Comey transformed the FBI into a corrupt, treasonous deep state apparatus that actively obstructed justice in order to make sure Hillary Clinton got elected President:
In the first draft of a statement former FBI Director James Comey prepared for the press when he discussed the bureau’s criminal investigation into then-Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton last summer, he dropped language that would have directly implicated her in a crime.

The point is, unless President Trump is literally killed in some brazen assassination coup — which is always a possibility — he’s going to make sure Hillary Clinton and her cohorts get indicted. Regardless of what happens in the 2018 mid-terms, Trump is still President through 2020, and there’s no way he’s leaving office without making sure the corrupt deep state gets some serious payback.
The unhinged Left, of course, will immediately start rioting once Hillary Clinton gets indicted. Once the riots begin, I fully expect “kinetic engagement” to begin. Note that I do not support such bloodshed, and I don’t condone it. The last thing I want to see is the blood of Americans spilled on the streets of America. Yet I fear this is exactly where things are headed for the simple reason that Leftists can no longer participate in a free society in any rational, lawful way. They are deranged, hate-filled lunatics who despise law and order and literally seek to murder their political enemies. The very idea that their own deep state treasonous swamp creatures might face the rule of law will drive Leftists to unhinged extremism, which is likely to include their bombing of government buildings, mass arson, chaos in the streets, the widespread targeting of police officers and the attempted murdering of conservatives and Trump supporters.
The extreme intolerance, irrationality, anger and lawlessness of the Left, in other words, is simply irreconcilable with a free society. The current situation cannot persist much longer without something breaking.
We aren’t far away from a trigger event that could unleash all this. In fact, as I’ve explained on Natural News, there are globalist elements that actively seek to push America into a civil war in order to call for United Nations “peacekeeping” intervention (run by Obama, of course).

https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/04/29/3-revelations-from-new-york-times-reporters-book-on-hillary-clinton/,3 Revelations From New York Times Reporter’s Book on Hillary Clinton,"Katrina Trinko is managing editor of The Daily Signal and co-host of The Daily Signal podcast. She is also a member of USA Today's Board of Contributors. Send an email to Katrina.
New York Times reporter Amy Chozick’s new book on her time covering Hillary Clinton doesn’t show either her employer, The New York Times, or Clinton herself in a particularly flattering light.
Chozick, a member of the largely female press corps that followed Clinton on a near-daily basis at times, crisscrossing the country with her, reported on Clinton’s 2008 campaign for The Wall Street Journal and her 2016 campaign for The New York Times. And in “Chasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns, and One Intact Glass Ceiling,” Chozick talks about what it was really like.
I’ve assembled three of the revelations I found most interesting. But first, a couple of caveats: I’m not familiar with Chozick’s reporting for the Times, so all my assessments are based on a reading of the book itself. And secondly, Chelsea Clinton is already alleging Chozick got facts wrong, although Chozick is pushing back, noting her book was reviewed by a fact-checker.
Now to dive in …
Hillary Clinton didn’t act like a feminist heroine on the campaign trail.
For years, it’s been drummed into us that Clinton is a feminist icon. Even Chozick’s book title, with its mention of “one intact glass ceiling,” hypes Clinton’s status in women’s history.
But Clinton herself doesn’t come off as very feminist, or supportive of women, in Chozick’s account. She writes:
The thing about a mostly female press corps was that Hillary likes men, preferably the damaged, witty, brilliant kind. She told aides she knew women reporters would be harder on her. We’d be jealous and catty and more spiteful than men. We’d be impervious to her flirting.
Chozick also recounts that when she told Clinton staff that ABC’s David Muir, who Clinton was about to do an interview with, was rumored to be gay, a Clinton staffer said, “Shhhhh. Hillary can not know that.” (Emphasis in original.)
“For all the lesbian theories, Hillary enjoys nothing more than flirting with a handsome, preferably straight man,” Chozick adds.
In fact, according to Chozick, Clinton’s preference for male reporters went so far as to make her tolerate Fox News. “Hillary loved to spar with Ed Henry. She would regularly look past her almost entirely female press corps to call on the Fox News correspondent with his cherub cheeks and Pucci pocket squares,” she writes.
And when Chozick wrote an article (presumably this piece) about concerns about how the Clintons historically had treated women who claimed Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them, Hillary Clinton was furious: “Hillary erupted after that piece, angry I’d written about the Lena [Dunham] anecdote (which her publicist said had been mischaracterized) and quoted other young women wrestling with this issue.”
When I asked Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill for comment on Clinton’s depiction in Chozick’s book, he said: “I don’t want to get into the [he] said/she said on the individual facts in the book, but I will say that Hillary Clinton has spent her entire career championing women, and by action and example has always encouraged those around her—both men and women—to follow her example.”
The Clinton campaign didn’t treat women well.
A Clinton communications staffer, unnamed in the book but known to be Philippe Reines, once made a sexually crude comment to Chozick. She writes that the staffer said, paraphrasing from the movie “Thank You for Smoking”: “I didn’t know I had to say it was off the record when I was inside you.”
Asked about the incident, Reines said in an email to The Daily Signal:
I genuinely regret quoting a line from the movie ‘Thank You for Smoking’ that left Amy uncomfortable. It was certainly not my intention. Had she told me then or anytime over the five years before including it in her book, I would have immediately apologized to her. I hope she accepts my doing so now.
For more details on Reines’ views on Chozick’s book and this incident, read his Daily Signal op-ed here.
When New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd broke the news that then-Vice President Joe Biden was seriously considering running in 2016, it was Chozick who wrote the news story that made the front page. She recounts, using the word Brooklyn to mean Clinton campaign headquarters:
Hillary interpreted our Biden reporting as another Times smear. She sent the message to all her top aides. [Clinton strategist] Joel Benenson must’ve bitched me out for an hour. Maureen got it worse—in terms Brooklyn would’ve called sexist, had they been directed at Hillary.
‘What is wrong with this woman?!’ Huma [Abedin, Clinton aide] wrote, when a press aide emailed Maureen’s column around.
‘Just when she’d seemed to quiet down … ‘ [Clinton campaign manager] Robby Mook replied.
‘She is full of self-loathing,’ [Clinton communications director] Jen Palmieri chimed in.
The New York Times doesn’t come off as objective.
One fascinating nugget from Chozick’s book is how much, by her account, the Clintons hate The New York Times, still furious over stories published in the ’90s.
But while the Times and the Clinton camp may have had plenty of tension—including the Clinton campaign’s regularly berating Chozick for her coverage—the Times also didn’t appear to operate like an objective outlet.
For instance, Chozick recounts of an article about Libya during the primaries: “The Times, afraid the story could affect the race, decided not to publish it until after the polls closed in South Carolina.”
Based on the fact that South Carolina’s Democratic primary was Feb. 27 and this Times story about Libya has a posting date of Feb. 27, 2016, on Google, I’m assuming Chozick means the article headlined, “Hillary Clinton, ‘Smart Power’ and a Dictator’s Fall.” Sure enough, the subhed suggests this wasn’t a pro-Hillary story: “The president was wary. The secretary of state was persuasive. But the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi left Libya a failed state and a terrorist haven.”
But since when does a news outlet that portrays itself as nonideological and nonpartisan care about how the timing of its articles could affect an election?
Asked about Chozick’s allegation, Eileen Murphy, senior vice president of communications for The New York Times, said in an email, “The editor on this story does not believe it was held for any reason.”
Chozick also recounts that both she and her editors didn’t see the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting as problematic. “In keeping with my inability to gauge Clinton scandals, I didn’t initially realize that a little tarmac small talk would become a major story … when I first ran it by my editors, they told me I could skip it.”
So let’s refresh: The spouse of a current presidential contender and a former president himself, whose wife is under FBI investigation for her use of email while secretary of state, talks to the attorney general and it’s no big deal. OK!
And while Chozick co-authored an article looking deeply into Clinton Foundation intrigue, she has a curious perspective on it. Recalling a pre-campaign trip to Africa to see firsthand the work of the foundation, Chozick writes, “It’s hard to care whether some sleazy foreign donor wants something from the State Department after you’ve seen a child hear for the first time.”
Actually, no, it’s not. The concern about the Clinton Foundation was never that the foundation didn’t do any good. The concern was whether the foundation was effectively allowing rich donors access to, or influence with, Hillary Clinton and the State Department that they wouldn’t otherwise have.
There’s also Chozick’s attitudes toward Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina. Of Fiorina, Chozick writes, “A lot of what came out of her mouth was borderline crazy, but I still admired Carly’s ballsy self-delusion.” (Although, to her credit, Chozick is surprised that Clinton isn’t interested in complimenting Fiorina’s fellow attempt to break the glass ceiling.)
Describing her first time watching Trump campaign, Chozick dismissively writes of his speech: “You can’t sell air forever.” She references the “racist undertones” of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.
In the end, Chozick’s book mainly reads as a reminder of how insane political campaigns and reporting have gotten at the presidential level. My favorite part is when she describes the press rolling an orange over toward the staff and candidate section of the plane with a question on its peel, getting an answer back on the orange, and then having a panicked staff say that wasn’t an on-the-record answer from Clinton herself, but had been written by someone else.
In fact, throughout the book, Chozick describes how little access Clinton’s campaign would give reporters to Clinton herself and to any insights about her—and how even as a sympathetic reporter, she was given virtually no material to use.
“How could we communicate Hillary’s ‘funny, wicked, and wacky side’ to voters if we never saw it ourselves?” Chozick writes.
Suddenly, the no-holds-barred tweets from Trump look a lot more appealing.",hillary
http://epoliticsinfo.com/2017/07/21/pay-play-clinton-state-department-revealed-huma-abedin-emails/,"‘Pay For Play’ In Clinton State Department, Revealed From Huma Abedin Email’s","On Aug. 8, 2015, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton submitted a sworn declaration to
the Department of Justice. In that statement, she said that she had turned over
55,000 pages of emails — and that she had made sure to include
anything that might be considered “federal records.”
Huma Abedin had an email account on the same server and that is
confirmed by the one and only Hillary Clinton.
Huma’s emails resulted in further investigation
into Hillary Clinton — email’s and investigation
that are one of the main reasons she lost the presidential
election is what many believe.
But, Abedin is not finished yet!.
Judicial Watch published 448 additional pages of emails that
claim to reveal additional questionable activity that took
place within the Clinton-led State Department:
Judicial Watch released 448 pages of documents from
the U.S. Department of State revealing new
incidents of Huma Abedin, that was deputy chief of staff
to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
providing special State Department treatment to major donors
to the Clinton Foundation and political campaigns.
The heavily redacted documents from Abedin’s
non-government account include an email from
Hillary Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, to Abedin revealing that he acted as a go-between for
a Clinton Foundation donor, Richard Park. And they reveal Clinton Foundation executive
Doug Band instructing Abedin to “show love” to Clinton donor Andrew Liveris.
And six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department included in the
document from Judicial Watch, bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of
the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a
statement by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department.
The email’s outlined a continuing pattern of “pay for play” noted the Judicial Watch
July 2009, in reference to the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Clinton Global Initiative head
Doug Band told Abedin that she “Need[s] to show love” to Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical.
Band also asked for Liveris to be introduced to Hillary, “and have her mention both me and wjc”.
Dow gave between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.
Band also pushes for Clinton to do a favor for Karlheinz Koegel, a major Clinton Foundation contributor,
who wanted Hillary Clinton to give the “honor speech” for his media prize to “Merkel.”
The emails reveal that on June 19, 2009, Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, passed a long a letter for
Hillary Clinton for Clinton donor Richard Park. Park donated $100,000 to Bill Clinton as far back as
1993 and is listed by the Clinton Foundation as a $100,000 to $250,000 donor.
On November 14, 2009, Clinton donor Ben Ringel, who has appeared in numerous prior emails asking for favors,
emailed Abedin to get help in getting an Iranian woman a visa to come to the United States.
He writes: “We need to get her clearance even only temporary to be with her granddaughter.”
Abedin forwarded the request to Lauren Jiloty, asking her “Can U help Monday with consular affairs?”
Jiloty replies, “Sure. Will look into it.” Ringel donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
In May, Band, working through Abedin, attempts to help Canadian concert promoter and Foundation donor
Michael Cohl with the processing of a visa. Abedin passes the request to Monica Hanley, Clinton’s “confidential assistant.”
In addition to the “free flow of information and requests for favors” between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department,
Judicial Watch claims that the emails also showed that at least one Clinton Foundation operative had a
fair amount of influence over personnel decisions within the State Department as well.
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton responded to the latest information dump by questioning why a new
investigation hasn’t yet been opened: “I’m not sure how much more evidence of pay for play,
classified information mishandling, and influence peddling from
Clinton’s email server one would need to show a serious criminal investigation is required.”",hillary
http://epoliticsinfo.com/2017/06/01/breaking-hillarys-mental-health-collapsing-thinks-president/,BREAKING: Hillary’s Mental Health Is Collapsing… Thinks She Is President,"Hillary Clinton’s grasp on reality is slipping away after three months of solemn binge drinking.
Hillary Clinton is having a difficult time grappling with her historic electoral defeat. She has lost touch with reality. In a recent puff piece for New York Magazine, Clinton claimed she beat Trump in the 2016 election.
The sycophantic reporter asked Clinton if her competitors Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump capitalized on the anger of the American people. “Yes,” Clinton claimed assuredly. “And I beat both of them.”
Hillary Clinton spent the majority of the interview in a whirlwind of anger, blaming everyone but herself for the devastating election loss.
Clinton blames the usual targets — James Comey and Russia — for her defeat, but added the right-wing “advocacy” press and voter suppression in key swing states.
Clearly, Clinton knows that the Russia-collusion accusations will soon be proven as a faked conspiracy theory. She is pivoting the blame to the latest targets. In particular, she bemoaned supposed negative press coverage.
Despite the fact that the entire mainstream media was in the bag for a Clinton presidency, the former first lady claims she lost because the press was unfair to HER.
Even though not one major publication endorsed Trump and the supposedly unbiased news anchors cried on air reporting the results, Clinton still thinks the press was biased against her. Anything but complete domination of the media would be unfair in Clinton’s eyes.
“They have a mission. They use the rights given to them under the First Amendment to advocate a set of policies that are in their interests, their commercial, corporate, religious interests,” Clinton said. “Because the advocacy media occupies the Right, and the center needs to be focused on providing as accurate information as possible. Not both-sides-ism and not false equivalency.”
We dodged a bullet. In this statement, Clinton made it clear that she has no respect for our constitutional rights. Freedom of speech is not “given” to us by a gracious government. Our rights are inalienable and the foundation of freedom. Clinton shows the disdain she has for our rights, which would have suffered under a Clinton presidency.
If Clinton won she would have waged war on political dissent, forcing us to rely on the “accurate information” offered by CNN and MSNBC.
Clinton lost because We the People were allowed to spread the truth about this wretched woman. Thank God for the First Amendment — not the state.

http://fantasydad.com/,Rap Sheet: The Women Who Claim to Be Victims of Bill and Hillary Clinton,"While Bill Cosby is finally doing a long overdue perp walk for an alleged sexual assault some 10 years ago, and I say “long overdue” because dozens of woman claim he did the same to them over the decades, the dozen or so women who claim to be victims of Bill and Hillary Clinton are being victimized once again by a DC Media circling the wagons to protect Hillary, a woman they are desperate to see become president.
—
—
The DC Media is not just politically motivated. Race also plays a factor. The DC Media see black conservatives as apostates who must be destroyed for daring to escape the Left-Wing Thought Plantation. On top of Bill Cosby, and over far, far lesser allegations, this same media has attempted to destroy two powerful black men: Justice Clarence Thomas and Herman Cain.
Despite a laundry list of extremely disturbing allegations involving everything from rape to groping to harassment to character assassination, the DC Media has not only protected white Democrat Bill Clinton, in a number of cases, the media has joined the campaign to destroy these women.
The double standard is glaring.
The pattern is horrifying.
And according to more than one of these alleged victims, Hillary Clinton is Bill’s enabler and the chief protector of their abuser:
The Clintons’ “systematically abuse women and others – sexually, physically, and psychologically – in their scramble for power and wealth,” says [“The Clintons’ War On Women”] press release.
Hillary Clinton’s core agenda is a quest for power, even while she presents herself as champion of women’s issues, [Roger]Stone says.
“If Hillary intends to build her campaign around an appeal to women, her campaign is built on quicksand,” said Stone. But “Hillary is a life-time abuser of women and her advocacy on women issues rings hollow,” he said.
Nevertheless, Bill Clinton is the man the DC Media wants as America’s very first First Gentleman, and other than Donald Trump, no one in the Republican Party has the stomach to make this the issue it deserves to be.
Kathleen Willey … made a splash in 1998 by claiming in a ’60 Minutes’ interview that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her during a Oval Office meeting in 1993.

Now she says Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, has a history of trying to silence the multiple women her husband has slept with, sexually assaulted or sexually harassed since his 1980s Arkansas days.

In 1974, a female student at the University of Arkansas complained that then-law school instructor Bill Clinton tried to prevent her from leaving his office during a conference. She said he groped her and forced his hand inside her blouse. She complained to her faculty advisor who confronted Clinton, but Clinton claimed the student ”came on” to him.
Paula Jones – Sexual Harrassment,. Character Assassination
She had asked to meet him because it would be ‘exciting’ to meet the governor, and she hoped it might lead to promotion. Instead, she said in court, she found herself telling him she was ‘not that kind of girl’.
It was a brief encounter and she alleged that Mr. Clinton took her hand, pulled her towards him, then said: ‘I love your curves.’
She tried to walk away, she said in a deposition, but ‘Mr. Clinton then walked over to the sofa, lowered his trousers and underwear, exposed his penis (which was erect) and told me to “kiss it.”‘ …
Jones delivers her own verdict on Hillary’s bid to become president, saying that her husband’s attitude towards women disqualifies Bill from re-entering the White House – while what she calls Hillary’s ‘lies’ disqualify her from the Oval Office.
‘There is no way that [Hillary] did not know what was going on, that women were being abused and accosted by her husband,’ she says. ‘They have both lied.’
Monica Lewinsky – Character Assassination
After lying to the American people to keep the Oval Office affair secret, Team Clinton and the DC Media ganged up on this 21-year-old intern to smear her as a crazy stalker.
—
A blue dress stained with the President’s DNA immediately shut down that media-enabled horror show.
Clinton was eventually impeached and disbarred for lying under oath about the affair. Under oath, when asked on three different occasions if he had an affair with Lewinsky, Clinton replied:
1. “No.”
2. “It’s certainly not the truth. It would not be the truth.”
3. “I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I’ve never had an affair with her.”
Flowers, who had a 12 year affair with Clinton, claims that Hillary Clinton ran a “war room” against her during the 1992 campaign, the goal being to “smear, defame, and harm” her in order to win the presidency.
Hillary trashed Flowers mercilessly as a liar and more in the 1992 interview embedded at the top of this post.

When Democrats and the DC Media and phony sexual assault activists like Lena Dunham insist we believe the victims, it is all a big fat lie.

It was the decision of head coach Mike Tomlin to not even take the field for the rendition of the national anthem.
Tomlin was humiliated when a Steelers player who was actually a military veteran ventured out of the locker room and to the end of the tunnel where he stood with his hand over his heart while the Star-Spangled banner boomed through the loudspeakers at Soldier Field.
The decision of offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva to go rogue to pay homage to his country and his flag enraged Coach Tomlin and likely a good number of his fellow teammates. It was a total shit show made worse by an overtime loss to the putrid Bears.
Villanueva, however, was a hero to many but has now been made to submit by his team and likely the NFL itself which has created one hell of a mess for itself by turning the keys over the Kaepernick cult.

On June 13, 2016 CBS Sports reported “Steelers coach Mike Tomlin to host expensive Hillary Clinton fundraiser”:
Although Ben Roethlisberger has decided to keep his distance from Donald Trump, not everyone in the Steelers’ organization plans to stay out of politics during the upcoming election season.
As a matter of fact, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin will be putting himself in the thick of things on Tuesday, when he’s expected to host a luncheon that will serve as a fundraiser for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
According to an event invitation obtained by TribLIVE.com, tickets to the event will cost anywhere between $10,000 and $33,400. The more expensive ticket will include a meeting with both Clinton and Tomlin.
Some Steelers fans were already mad enough to burn their team merchandise after Tomlin’s chickenshit moves on Sunday and many more will be madder than hell to hear about his blasting politics when that is ALL that this clown is about. The bonfires will burn brightly along the three rivers as black and gold merchandise is torched.
Now that Villanueva has been silenced and forced to grovel and beg for forgiveness is it too much to ask that Tomlin too should come out with it that he is a Clinton dead-ender and apologize to his team and the fans?

https://downtrend.com/donn-marten/sore-loser-hillary-calls-for-elimination-of-the-electoral-college,Sore Loser Hillary Calls for Elimination of the Electoral College,"Defeated Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton continues to make the stops on her national grievance tour to fulminate against the cruel system that snuffed out her hopes of making history as the country’s first female POTUS.
Mrs. Clinton’s sense of entitlement was forever shattered in the wee hours of November 9th when she smacked right into that glass ceiling like a fly on a windshield and she has been determined to do as much damage to that system ever since.
It wasn’t enough to just bow out with dignity and tact like the losers of all of the previous elections, she had to openly undermine President Trump and direct her devoted dead-ender followers to do whatever it took to RESIST! RESIST! RESIST!
This week, Clinton is hitting the media circuit to pound her bible of bitching What Happened? and blaming everyone and everything for her loss with the exception of the one that looks back at her in the mirror every morning.
And on Wednesday, she appeared on the Clinton News Network for a sit down with millionaire pretty boy anchor Anderson “pooper scooper” Cooper where she called for the elimination of the Electoral College.
Hillary Clinton: It's time to abolish the Electoral College https://t.co/z0QABCH4um pic.twitter.com/Ph5bvZ2UCo
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 14, 2017
According to CNN “Clinton: It’s time to abolish the Electoral College”:
Hillary Clinton told CNN on Wednesday that it is time to abolish the Electoral College, part of a sweeping interview where the former Democratic nominee sought to explain why she lost the 2016 election.
Clinton, in the interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, displayed her animus for fired FBI Director James Comey, reflected on her love for the people — namely former President Bill Clinton — who helped her get through the crushing loss and blasted the arcane election body that she believes helped Donald Trump win the presidency.
“I think it needs to be eliminated,” Clinton said of the Electoral College. “I’d like to see us move beyond it, yes.”
Like most liberals, Hillary suffers from a chronic case of pathological hypocrisy because you wouldn’t have heard a peep out of any of them if she had won because of the Electoral College.
In fact, her entire strategy was based on winning it but she made the fatal error of taking those critical Rust Belt states for granted and lost their precious electoral votes to Trump.
Just more of the same whine and liberals are gulping it by the gallon.

Schoen, Accepted Millions of Dollars to Agitate for War with Russia","In a remarkable conflict-of-interest, Fox News analyst and former Clinton operative Douglas E. Schoen has failed to disclosed to readers that he’s been paid millions of dollars from Ukrainian agents to incite a war between the United States and Russia. Before inciting war with Russia, Schoen worked for Bill Clinton and brokered meeting (for $40,000 a month) between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and billionaire oligarchs.
This shocking story reveals an entangled web of foreign money, propaganda, and a complete lack of ethics and transparency at Fox News.
Douglas E. Schoen has been paid millions of dollars by Victor Pinchuk, Ukranian oligarch, former member of Ukrainian parliament, and George Soros confederate.
Amy Chozik of the New York Times wrote about Schoen’s connections with Victor Pinchuk. In “Trade Dispute Centers on Ukrainian Executive With Ties to Clintons,” Chozik reveals:
Mr. Schoen had been on a $40,000-per-month retainer as an adviser to Mr. Pinchuk since 2000. In 2011, Mr. Schoen, who had never previously done any lobbying, registered as a lobbyist for him to set up meetings with Washington officials to discuss the political crisis in Ukraine.
Pinchuk was a member of Ukrainian parliament from 1998 to 2006, and thus Schoen was paid $40,000 a month by a foreign government while he himself had close Clinton ties.
Schoen began as an errand boy for Pinchuk, doing run-of-the-mill corruption like using his access to the Clinton family to arrange meetings.
Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton have built a sprawling network of powerful friends around the globe, one that could aid Mrs. Clinton’s chances were she to seek the presidency. But those relationships often come with intersecting interests and political complications; few people illustrate that more vividly than the Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk.
A steel magnate and major contributor to the former president’s foundation, Mr. Pinchuk was in frequent contact with Mrs. Clinton’s State Department, at meetings arranged by a Clinton political operative turned lobbyist, Douglas E. Schoen.
Schoen has moved beyond “Clinton Cash” style corruption and into agitating for a war between the United States and Russia.
Americans who lobby for foreign governments are required to register as Foreign Agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Department of Justice makes these reports, along with financial disclosures, available.
Nevertheless Fox News does not require its analysts to disclose these ties.

These payments of $80,000 a year continued every year according to the FARA reports.

Schoen writes about the Ukraine regularly at FoxNews.com. In one such article, “In a world of chaos, the only clear winner is Vladimir Putin,” Schoen writes:
Before Putin illegally annexed Crimea, Clinton went to Yalta and warned the Russians against aggression. The Russians came anyway. Since then, she has scarcely criticized the administration for its refusal to meaningfully aid an increasingly desperate Ukraine.
His article continues:
Putin has a clear strategy that has propelled him to military victory in Crimea, and he holds strong positions in Syria and Ukraine. He is on a mission to advance Russian interests around the world and reestablish Russia as a global superpower. We are doing nothing to stop him, and our politicians have no serious plan for the future.

Schoen writes about the Ukraine often at Fox News. In “On foreign policy, Hillary Clinton leans more to the right than Donald Trump,” co-authored with Judith Miller, Schoen states:
On Russia, while Mrs. Clinton has called Putin a “bully” and has described the relationship between Washington and Moscow as “complicated,” Mr. Trump has floated the idea of establishing a new alliance with Russia, whose cooperation he says is needed to help end the six-year war in Syria, fight terrorism, and diffuse tensions. While he says that more should be done to support Ukraine, which has been battling Russia-backed separatists since Russia annexed Crimea, he has not detailed what specifically he would do to help end Russia’s occupation of Crimea and combat Russian meddling in Kiev’s internal affairs.
When you scroll to the bottom of the page, you’ll see that Schoen has neglected to admit his payments from a Ukrainian agent yet again.
A review of Schoen’s articles note a similar pattern. He does not disclose payments he is required to disclose under the Foreign Registered Agents Act.
See, “Putin Is Sponsoring Sectarian Violence in Ukraine” by Schoen, a NewsMax article taking a strong anti-Russia, pro-Ukraine stance:
We can only hope that Obama changes his mind and chooses to defend the global values that the United States and its allies stand for. But if he does not, then he should consider that while America stands idly by, Putin is sponsoring sectarian violence that is claiming the lives of hundreds of Ukrainians and could easily claim the lives of hundreds more.

Those brainwashed by hoaxing media will find this outrageous, until they watch the video from a 1997 “performance.” Occult symbolism, as I’ve reported on extensively, is done openly to taunt the public. It’s a form of power and control. Secret Societies do not want to remain secret.

Additional emails from the release reveal Hillary’s efforts to protect Laura Silsby, who was caught trafficking 33 children from Haiti. Where were those children being smuggled to?
Perhaps those children were destined for Jeffrey Epstein’s “pedophile island,” a sex cult resort that Bill Clinton visited dozens of times. Notably, Clinton refused to allow his Secret Service detail to accompany him several times.
Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” — even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.
Julian Assange claimed that the Wikileaks would send Hillary Clinton to prison. The releases initially disappointed many people, this reporter included, as the evidence of corruption was slim.
Assange was right. The real story was hidden in view.
These Podesta emails detail connections to sex cults and human trafficking, and we should focus less on Clinton Cash style corruption and more on the Clinton Foundation’s sale of children to Saudi pedophiles.

Schoen, Accepted Millions of Dollars to Agitate for War with Russia","In a remarkable conflict-of-interest, Fox News analyst and former Clinton operative Douglas E. Schoen has failed to disclosed to readers that he’s been paid millions of dollars from Ukrainian agents to incite a war between the United States and Russia. Before inciting war with Russia, Schoen worked for Bill Clinton and brokered meeting (for $40,000 a month) between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and billionaire oligarchs.
This shocking story reveals an entangled web of foreign money, propaganda, and a complete lack of ethics and transparency at Fox News.
Douglas E. Schoen has been paid millions of dollars by Victor Pinchuk, Ukranian oligarch, former member of Ukrainian parliament, and George Soros confederate.
Amy Chozik of the New York Times wrote about Schoen’s connections with Victor Pinchuk. In “Trade Dispute Centers on Ukrainian Executive With Ties to Clintons,” Chozik reveals:
Mr. Schoen had been on a $40,000-per-month retainer as an adviser to Mr. Pinchuk since 2000. In 2011, Mr. Schoen, who had never previously done any lobbying, registered as a lobbyist for him to set up meetings with Washington officials to discuss the political crisis in Ukraine.
Pinchuk was a member of Ukrainian parliament from 1998 to 2006, and thus Schoen was paid $40,000 a month by a foreign government while he himself had close Clinton ties.
Schoen began as an errand boy for Pinchuk, doing run-of-the-mill corruption like using his access to the Clinton family to arrange meetings.

Hillary’s health is declining, as anyone who has looked at her can see. The question is: What condition does she have? A board certified Anesthesiologist has written a memo of Hillary’s health. Feel free to pass it along to doctors and to analytics and criticize it.
UPDATE! The doctor who wrote this has agreed to give up his anonymity. Here is a video summary of his findings.
Hillary Clinton’s Probable Diagnosis
(Download the PDF here, share with doctors for their opinion.)
Intro:
Hillary Clinton (HRC) has suffered a variety of health issues. Unfortunately, she has declined to make her medical records public. In July of 2015 her personal physician released a letter asserting her “excellent physical condition.” Unfortunately, multiple later episodes recorded on video strongly suggest that the content of the letter is incorrect. This discussion is designed to sort through the known facts and propose a possible medical explanation for these events. In keeping with Occam’s Razor, a single explanation that covers everything is preferred.
History of Hillary’s Health:
In 2009, HRC fell and broke her elbow. Little else was made public.[i]
On December 17, 2012, while Secretary of State, HRC fell and suffered a concussion.[ii] Later, a transverse sinus thrombosis was diagnosed, resulting in chronic anticoagulation therapy. [iii] Her post-concussion syndrome was declared “recovered” in about six months.[iv] The original fall was publicly attributed to dehydration following gastroenteritis.
An email from Huma Abedin (HRC’s closest advisor) on January 26, 2013, says that HRC “is often confused.”[v]
Photos show being assisted up what appears to be the steps of a residential porch. This apparently happened in February of 2016. On August 4, 2016, Reuters and Getty published the photos.[vi]
At a rally on May 2, 2016, HRC demonstrates classic PD hand posturing.[vii] She has no lectern in front, so she starts with her right hand pressed against her chest. At the 18:02 mark, she starts gesturing with her right hand, which is in a very unnatural position that is common in PD.
On July 21, 2016 HRC was filmed talking to reporters at close range when several spoke at once. Without warning, she started a bizarre head-bobbing episode that must be seen rather than described. After several cycles, she regained control and declared that the reporters “must try the iced chai.”[viii]
On July 28, 2016, during the balloon drop, HRC suddenly looks up with a frozen wide-mouth and wide-eyed stare. After a couple of seconds she regains control and a more normal expression.[ix]
On August 5, HRC declared that she had “short circuited”[x] a response to Chris Wallace in an interview that aired July 31 on Fox News Sunday.[xi]
August 6, 2016, at a campaign rally, HRC freezes with wide eyes in response to protestors. A large black male who commonly accompanies her leans in and tells her “It’s OK. We’re not going anywhere. Keep talking…” Shortly after, she laughs strangely and then says “OK. Here we are. We’ll keep talking.”[xii]
Several recent photos show HRC with an inappropriately exaggerated wide-mouthed smile and extreme wide-open eyes. Several videos show her laughing inappropriately and for extended periods. Numerous events have been interrupted by prolonged episodes of coughing unrelated to any infectious cause.
This discussion will not argue that the black male is carrying a diazepam injector, since there is a plausible argument that it is actually a small flashlight, and is seen in other video to be such. We will also not discuss the circular area on her tongue. It appears to be the site of a mass excision. Benign explanations that do not bear on chronic health issues may easily be proffered.
Discussion:
The HRC campaign meme is that “there’s nothing to see here.”
But numerous trained observers have noted multiple other, more subtle bits that strongly support the argument below.
After the 2012 fall, HRC had post-concussion syndrome (PCS). She should have declared herself unable to fulfill her duties as Secretary of State. Her resignation from the position shortly thereafter may have satisfied this need without public medical discussion. If no other questionable medical signs had appeared, this discussion would end here. But the other events and signs point to a single cause for the fall, and it is not the public explanation. Further, HRC’s statement early in her tenure as Secretary of State that she would serve only four years can be read in the context of a progressive disease that was known as she assumed the post.
It is the premise of this discussion the HRC is most likely suffering from Parkinson’s Disease (PD).
It explains every one of the items listed above. Further, since it is a diagnosis primarily made by observation, the video record is sufficient to create a high degree of certainty.
The 2009 fall where HRC broke her elbow suggests that she had working protective reflexes, and her arm took the brunt of the fall. But three years later, she had a catastrophic fall where her reflexes were unable to help her. It is notable that this fall took place at home, where she would have been unstressed and in a familiar setting. Failing reflexes are common in PD. Poor balance is also common in PD, and a fall without working protective reflexes is a prescription for head injury. Her subsequent concerns with transverse sinus thrombosis are plausibly related to the fall. Her need for fresnel lens glasses also fits with post-concussion syndrome.
Huma Abedin’s email comment can be referring to PCS as well, since it was during the six-month period of rehab. One must, however, be cautious not to overlook persistent cognitive problems that PCS can have. (Editorial note: The reader will note that this discussion is giving the benefit of the doubt to as many HRC memes as can reasonably earn it.)
2016 starts a spate of new data. The photos of HRC being helped up the steps is consistent with a fall similar to 2012, but with a security detail close enough to catch her before she fell to the ground. This matches the loss of reflexes and balance with PD.
On July 21 a video of HRC is posted that has many observers calling a “seizure.”
We should note the setting. She is answering questions, and then multiple reporters call out at the same time. Such a shock is often too much stress for a PD patient, and the patient suffers an “on/off” episode. Higher control turns off and an unpredictable dyskinesia takes over. Shortly she switches back “on” and regains control. Her mind froze during the “off” state, but was aware, so she is able to speak again, but inappropriately.
It should be noted that such dyskinesias are sufficiently common with long term treatment that they have a name: Parkinson’s Disease LevoDopa Induced Dyskinesia (PD LID).
A week later, during the balloon drop at the Convention, HRC suddenly “freezes.” This is an “off” moment manifested by bradykinesia, another PD problem. The particular form is a brief oculogyric crisis, complete with head arched back, fixed gaze, and wide open mouth. Again, this is common in PD. We should compare it to HRC’s facial expressions on “Live with Kelly and Michael” on November 19, 2015.[xiii] At 6:30 in that video, we also see a PD tremor and posture in her left hand when it comes to rest momentarily. In most videos her hands are in constant motion or clasped against some object. These are strategies to suppress a tremor.
HRC’s description of her false answers to Chris Wallace as a “short circuit” is extremely unusual.
It comes from the field of electronics, in which HRC has never been involved. The Urban Dictionary definition is electrical, and there is no popular or slang usage. But one semi-technical description of PD calls it “short-circuiting” brain circuits.[xiv] Did she hear this during a doctor’s explanation of her disease? It would not be unusual to parrot such a phrase if she has PD.
Days later, HRC “freezes” again at a campaign rally. This “off” state is like the others, triggered by a startle/stress reaction. But what is more telling is that the security detail gives her specific instructions in an attempt to get her to turn “on” again. She then parrots those exact words as she restarts. This is another PD sign.
The numerous episodes of prolonged coughing are another tell. Swallowing disorders are very common in PD. They can lead to aspiration pneumonia, the most common cause of death in PD. But before that they lead to chronic difficulty swallowing saliva. It gets onto the vocal cords, leading to coughing in an attempt to clear them. The high frequency of these episodes strongly suggests a major swallowing disorder.
Multiple episodes of inappropriate and extended laughter have also been documented. This, again, is common in PD.
We do not have video evidence of the “pill rolling” tremor that is common in PD. But that is not a major concern for our thesis. Treatment with levodopa can reduce it. Also, PD sufferers develop a variety of techniques to hide it. Since it is a tremor at rest, keeping the hands in motion suppresses it. Grasping objects such as a lectern can also hide it. As long as the hands are busy, it is usually not visible.
Summary:
HRC probably has PD.
She has had clinical symptoms for a minimum of 4 years, and probably much longer, given that the fall leading to her head injury required a significant progression of the disease. All of her bizarre physical actions since that time fit nicely into the spectrum of signs that we expect in PD. And since PD explains all of them, we have a high probability of a correct diagnosis. It has almost certainly been treated with levodopa. Some of her symptoms may be related to this drug treatment.
It is most curious that all of the bizarre physical signs seem to be in 2016 videos. HRC was a public figure in 2015, with a lot of campaign work underway. Yet all of the oddities seem to be within the last several months. This suggests a significant progression of her PD. We also know that her contact with the public has been rigidly controlled. She has not done news conferences during the campaign. These would be highly stressful to a PD sufferer and would elicit many PD signs.
PD is a chronic disease with a downhill prognosis. HRC’s instability and frequent cough suggest that her PD is advanced. This is not a good outlook for someone running for the Presidency. The office of the President is one of the highest stress jobs in the world. Stress sets off PD episodes, which render the sufferer incapable of proper response.
At this point, a bit of speculation seems appropriate. HRC talks about her yoga sessions. But no one we know of has ever documented one. It is possible that this is cover for sessions designed to teach her coping mechanisms for PD or for rest breaks. Exhaustion makes PD worse.
HRC’s coughing suggests that her swallowing disorder is advanced, placing her closer to an aspiration pneumonia that would disable or kill her. That’s bad enough, but PD has one more, even more dangerous step in its progression.
As PD continues, cognitive problems can develop. In time, they become full-blown dementia. The United States cannot survive if its President is mentally impaired.
Conclusion:
It is not appropriate for a physician to make a diagnosis at a distance. But since the evidence in the public record so strongly suggests that HRC has moderate to advanced PD, it is imperative that HRC release her complete medical record to an impartial panel of physicians for review. It is not necessary for the public at large to see them. Such a panel should be secure in its deliberations and should present a summary to the public. If she has PD, the panel would know and it would be made public. If not, then the air would clear.
Note on authorship:
The author of this document is a board-certified Anesthesiologist with 36 years of experience. That brings with it the ability to understand medical discussions, but not the expertise to evaluate PD signs and symptoms.
The first subject matter expert is a close friend of the author. This person is a brilliant businessman who was forced to sell his interest in eight successful businesses because early onset PD made him unable to continue in the daily duties of business. He is well versed in PD and sees its ravages in himself.
The second subject matter expert is the author’s brother. He is an RN who spent two years working 12-hour shifts caring for PD patients in a nursing home. This saturation experience allows him to pick up PD signs automatically. He notes that he called HRC’s PD and levodopa therapy when he watched the famous “What difference does it make?” exchange. Her mannerisms and behavior were classic and stereotypical.
Of interest is that during a teleconference, the author called the others to look at HRC’s left hand during the “Live With Kelly and Michael” video. The clip was played, and neither of the others even saw her hand. They were both riveted to her eyes, and both exclaimed that her eyes were “classic PD.” The clip had to be played a second and third time before they could even take their gaze away from her eyes. They did finally see her hand and agree that it was also demonstrating PD.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1364618/hillary-slams-trumps-dangerous-war-of-words-with-north-korea,Hillary slams Trump's 'dangerous' war of words with North Korea,"Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slammed President Donald Trump's “dangerous and short-sighted” war of words with North Korea on Wednesday, saying his Twitter tirades only benefitted Pyongyang's attention-seeking ruler and hurt Washington's credibility.
Clinton lost last year's presidential election to the insurgent Republican despite having decades of experience in politics.
Tension has been running high for months as the White House's new incumbent and the North's Kim Jong-Un trade threats of war, with Trump dubbing Kim “Rocket Man” and being called a “dotard” in response.
In recent months Pyongyang has carried out multiple launches of missiles potentially capable of reaching the US mainland, and its sixth nuclear test.
But Trump's tit-for-tat with the young, autocratic ruler of the isolated regime only dents Washington's credibility and helps Kim bask in global attention he seeks, the former secretary of state told a forum in Seoul.
“I am worried about some of the recent actions from the new administration that seem to raise tensions. Our allies are now expressing concerns about America's credibility and reliability,” she said.
“Picking up fights with Kim Jong-Un just puts a smile on his face. It's like picking fights with Nato and the EU which puts a smile on Putin's face,” she added, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Trump's escalating verbal threats have sparked concerns of potential conflict on the peninsula, especially after he warned this month that “only one thing will work” on the North, without elaborating further.
Such “cavalierly threats to start a war are dangerous and short-sighted”, Clinton said, adding the regime would be “thrilled” to get the “personal attention of the leader of our country”.
Without once mentioning Trump by name, she also said she was “very concerned that the new administration is draining the government of the expertise” in diplomacy over the North.
“There are few Asia experts of senior level left at the State Department,” she said.
Alienating Washington's allies in Asia, where the clout of the world's number-two economy China has been rising to rival the US, could have “grave consequence”, she said: “If we pull back, it leaves a vacuum for others to fill.”
How to curb Kim's weapons ambitions is expected to be a major focus of Trump's trip to Asia next month that includes Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing among its stops.
US deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, who was also in Seoul on Wednesday for talks with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, defended Trump's comments.
“The regime in Pyongyang is unpredictable and not transparent,” he told reporters. “We and our allies have to be prepared for any eventuality. For that reason the president... said all options are on the table.”
Clinton, the former first lady who served as the US' top diplomat from 2009 to 2013 under president Barack Obama, suffered a shock defeat to Trump in the 2016 election.
She felt “so responsible” for the defeat, she said, but also blamed multiple factors including sexism, misogyny and Russian intervention she recounted in her recent memoir “What Happened”.
Moscow, she said, was “trying to destabilise every democracy”.
“It's not going to end at 2016 American campaign... it's an ongoing threat,” Clinton said, describing the suspected Russian campaign as “so successful... and very effective propaganda”.
Trump's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that his campaign team colluded with Russia during last year's election.
Moscow has faced accusations of state-sponsored cyberattacks on countries including Germany and France to influence election results ─ allegations it has steadfastly denied.",hillary
http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/national/16200787.Trump_hires_lawyer_who_represented_Clinton_in_impeachment/,Trump hires lawyer who represented Clinton in impeachment,"President Donald Trump has hired a veteran lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment process as the White House shifted to a more aggressive approach to the Russia investigation that has reached a critical stage.
The White House announced the hiring of lawyer Emmet Flood after disclosing the retirement of Ty Cobb, who for months has been the administration’s point person dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller.
It is the latest shake-up for a legal team grappling with unresolved questions on how to protect the president from legal and political jeopardy in Mr Mueller’s Russia probe, which is nearing its one-year anniversary.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Mr Cobb had been discussing the decision for weeks and would retire at the end of May, and that Mr Flood would be joining the White House staff to “represent the president and the administration against the Russia witch hunt”.
The replacement of Mr Cobb with Mr Flood may herald a more adversarial stance toward the Mueller team as Mr Trump’s lawyers debate whether to make the president available for an interview with the special counsel and brace for the prospect of a grand jury subpoena if they refuse.
Though Mr Cobb did not personally represent the president, he functioned as a critical point person for Mr Mueller’s document and interview requests, coordinated dealings with prosecutors and worked closely with Mr Trump’s personal lawyers.
He had repeatedly urged cooperation with the investigation in hopes of bringing it to a quick end, and viewed his role as largely finished now that interviews with dozens of current and former White House official have been completed.
Yet Mr Flood, who was embroiled in the bitterly partisan Clinton impeachment fight 20 years ago, may well advocate a more confrontational approach.
His law firm, Williams & Connolly, is one of Washington’s most prominent, with a reputation for aggressive advocacy for its clients and a history of tangling with the government — but also representing senior White House officials, including presidents.
Mr Flood, a former law clerk to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has defended former vice president Dick Cheney in a lawsuit brought by former CIA official Valerie Plame and represented George W Bush in executive-privilege disputes with Congress — suggesting he is well-versed in the powers of the presidency and may invoke those authorities as the Mueller investigation moves forward.
Mr Flood was always the top choice of White House counsel Don McGahn for the job Mr Cobb was given last summer, according to a person familiar with the hiring decision who described Flood as a “fighter”.
Mr Cobb and Mr McGahn had different views on how cooperative the White House should be with the special counsel investigation.
Mr Cobb’s retirement, though not a surprise, was nonetheless the latest evolution for a legal team marked by turnover.
“This isn’t some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.” John Dowd, March 2018. With North Korea, China, the Middle East and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian “Collusion.”
Mr Trump’s lead personal lawyer, John Dowd, left in March. Another lawyer who Mr Trump tried to bring on ultimately passed because of conflicts, and the president two weeks ago added former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a pair of former prosecutors, Martin and Jane Raskin, to work alongside mainstay lawyer Jay Sekulow.
Critical decisions lie ahead. The president’s legal team has not committed him to an interview with Mr Mueller, who has dozens of questions on a broad array of topics he would like to ask.
Mr Trump initially said he was eager for an interview, but he has not said so recently. His view of Mr Mueller soured further after raids last month that targeted one of his personal lawyers, Michael Cohen, in a separate investigation.
Those interview negotiations are hugely consequential, especially after Mr Dowd confirmed to The Associated Press this week that Mr Mueller’s team in March raised the prospect of issuing a grand jury subpoena for Mr Trump, an extraordinary idea that would seek to force a sitting president to testify under oath.
It was not immediately clear in what context the possibility of a subpoena was raised or how serious Mr Mueller’s prosecutors were about such a move.
Mr Mueller is probing not only Russian election interference and possible coordination with Trump associates but possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump after he took office.
If Mr Mueller’s team decides to subpoena Mr Trump as part of the investigation, the president could still fight it in court or refuse to answer questions by invoking his Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination.
Mr Trump lashed out against the investigation in familiar fashion on Wednesday, saying on Twitter: “There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap).”
There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!
Also on Wednesday, Mr Trump echoed the concerns of a small group of House conservatives who have been criticising the Justice Department for not turning over certain investigation documents.
“What are they afraid of?” Mr Trump tweeted. “At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!”
A Rigged System – They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal “justice?” At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!
It was unclear what Trump meant by “get involved”.
Several Republican House committee chairmen have recently negotiated deals with the Justice Department to turn over documents related to Russia investigations into Trump and also a 2016 investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton’s emails.
The Justice Department says that “dozens of members and staff from both parties” have viewed thousands of classified documents and House staff members have temporary office space in the department to review additional materials.
But some politicians who sit on those committees remain unsatisfied, particularly members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Some of them have asked for an unredacted version of a Justice Department document that sets out the scope for Mueller’s probe, a request that the department immediately denied because it pertains to an ongoing investigation.",hillary

The former US secretary of state and presidential hopeful was recognised for her commitment to promoting the rights of families and children around the world, a cause shared by the university’s Observatory on the Human Rights of Children and Young People.
Mrs Clinton called for “empathy” on both sides of the Atlantic and highlighted the plight of children in the UK.
.@HillaryClinton has been inaugurated to Swansea University’s honorary fellowship. #HRCSwanseaUni #Proud pic.twitter.com/a3X8apU1OL
— Swansea University (@SwanseaUni) October 14, 2017
In a speech at the university on Saturday afternoon, she said: “Teachers and schools are reporting an outbreak of bullying and racially motivated insults. Here in the UK, divisive rhetoric and policy shifts are having their own effects.
“Right now, the residency rights of half a million children, including many who were born in the UK, are hanging in the balance.
“So there are reports of children being worried, feeling uncertain, even unsafe. Trying to make sense of their places in the world.
“The children’s commissioners for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already raised concerns that children’s interests are getting short shrift in the Brexit process.”
“When we fail children, we fail ourselves, and we fail as a society”. #ChildrensRightsAreHumanRights #HRCSwanseaUni pic.twitter.com/YkzT5sMTCS
Some protesters gathered outside the campus ahead of Mrs Clinton’s visit.
The university’s college of law was renamed The Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law and she was presented with a book about her Welsh roots.
The former first lady appeared to take a swipe at the Trump administration, accusing political leaders of “stoking divisions” and saying that “anger and resentment” were underpinning the national conversation.
“The bonds of community that once united us are fraying. Too much of the current discourse on both sides of the Atlantic is dominated by a zero-sum view of life, which argues that if someone else is gaining, I must be losing,” she said.
“The measure of any society is how we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially our children. And when we lose empathy, when it does become everyone for themselves, children are the first to suffer.
“Just look at my own country where currents of anger and resentment are underpinning our national conversation.
“Americans are divided and less trusting of democratic institutions. But instead of bringing people together we have leaders who stoke our divisions, try to distract us with controversy, after controversy, and undermine free speech and the press.
“It is nearly impossible for children’s voices to rise above the cacophony. And it is not coincidence that when politicians in Washington were arguing over protests at sporting events and cavalierly alluding to nuclear war, one of the first things to fall through the cracks was children’s healthcare.”
Mrs Clinton’s great-grandparents were from south Wales and emigrated to the US in search of a better life. Her ethnic breakdown has been calculated by genealogists as 31.2% Welsh in origin.
In her lecture, Mrs Clinton said: “As a child growing up Wales was a part of my wider understanding because it had special place in my heart due to my family’s connections to it.”
Mrs Clinton said she planned on returning to Swansea in the future: “I feel a special connection to the work of this school because your central focus on children’s human rights is my life’s mission.”",hillary

If the following exclusive report from The Daily Mail is true, then the entire Clinton narrative just fell apart.
A Wikileaks envoy today claims he personally received Clinton campaign emails in Washington D.C. after they were leaked by ‘disgusted’ whisteblowers – and not hacked by Russia.
Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close associate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, told Dailymail.com that he flew to Washington, D.C. for a clandestine hand-off with one of the email sources in September.
‘Neither of [the leaks] came from the Russians,’ said Murray in an interview with Dailymail.com on Tuesday. ‘The source had legal access to the information. The documents came from inside leaks, not hacks.’
His account contradicts directly the version of how thousands of Democratic emails were published before the election being advanced by U.S. intelligence.
…
He said the leakers were motivated by ‘disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders.’
Murray said he retrieved the package from a source during a clandestine meeting in a wooded area near American University, in northwest D.C. He said the individual he met with was not the original person who obtained the information, but an intermediary.
It has been rumored that DNC staffer Seth Rich may have been murdered on a D.C. street for his role in releasing documents to Wikileaks. Though no official confirmation has been provided from Wikileaks as to the source, an August interview with Julian Assange suggests that people have been killed as a result of the information leaked to the organization, including quite possibly Seth Rich.
Craig Murray’s claims of direct DNC whistleblower involvement is not the only revelation to have be released regarding the supposed “sophisticated hacking” originating from Russia. It appears that the John Podesta emails, which have led to countless reports on #Pizzagate and the corruption underlying the American political system, had nothing to do with a sophisticated operation as first claimed. According to liberal mouthpiece The Huffington Post, that “hack” occurred as a result of a typo by an IT technician when Podesta clicked a standard phishing email:
Most adult internet users know by now never to click a link in emails like this ― phishing is fairly common. Even unsophisticated tech types are hip to the scam. So, before responding, Podesta’s aide showed the email to another staffer, a computer technician.
And, well, what happens next should be a lesson to anyone who types and sends emails and texts without reading them first. (That’s everybody who emails and texts.)
“This is a legitimate email,” Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, repliedto another of Mr. Podesta’s aides, who had noticed the alert. “John needs to change his password immediately.”
With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account — a total of about 60,000 — were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an “illegitimate” email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.
And just like that, any and all claims of Russian hacking have just been utterly discredited.

http://endingthefed.com/new-emails-prove-marines-were-waiting-for-orders-hillary-lied-4-americans-died-in-benghazi.html,New Emails PROVE Marines Were Waiting For Orders. Hillary LIED ~ 4 American’s DIED In Benghazi!,"Dc Gazette An email recently obtained by Judicial Watch shows that the Pentagon was demanding Hillary allow them to send help to Benghazi during the 2012 attack. This would completely contradict the claim from Hillary and Leon Panetta that no forces were available and within reach to provide help to the compound that was under siege.
As the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was unfolding, a high-ranking Pentagon official urgently messaged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s top deputies to offer military help, according to an email obtained by Judicial Watch.
The revelation appears to contradict testimony Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave lawmakers in 2013, when he said there was no time to get forces to the scene in Libya, where four Americans were killed, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.
“I just tried you on the phone but you were all in with S [apparent reference to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton],” reads the email, from Panetta’s chief of staff Jeremy Bash. “After consulting with General Dempsey, General Ham and the Joint Staff, we have identified the forces that could move to Benghazi. They are spinning up as we speak.”
The email was sent out at 7:19 p.m. ET on Sept. 11, 2012, in the early stages of the eight-hour siege that also claimed the lives of Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs, Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, private CIA contractors who raced to the aid of embattled State Department workers.
Although the email came after the first wave of the attack at the consulate, it occurred before a mortar strike on the CIA annex killed Woods and Doherty.
“This leaves no doubt military assets were offered and ready to go, and awaiting State Department signoff, which did not come,” Judicial Watch, a nonprofit government watchdog said in a statement.
Parts of the email from Bash were redacted before release, including details on what military forces were available.

At Bridgeport’s annual Lincoln Day fundraising dinner in Connecticut, he told the audience that he would work day and night to help Republicans shine a light on what exactly went down on Sept. 11, 2012.
“I don’t think she has a soul,” Paronto said during an interview with the Connecticut Post. “I hope it haunts her. I don’t think it will.”
Not only does she not seem to have a soul, she probably doesn’t have a conscience either — she will do whatever she can, no matter how corrupt it may be, to increase her power and wealth.
“You have a State Department that is giving stand-down orders when our embassy is under attack and our ambassador is killed,” said John Slater, Bridgeport’s former GOP chairman.
“She lied to the family members, period,” Paronto said. “People are believing her over the family members of teammates that I lost.”
The entire incident that took place in Libya seems to become more preposterous with age — any mediocre government would have provided backup for its own soldiers. What does that say about the Obama administration? Nothing good.
That verdict was reinforced by the story found in “13 Hours,” the movie that gave an account of the Benghazi attacks and sparked a firestorm of debate late last year — it’s still being viewed and it’s still exposing our inept government.
“It was not a political movie,” Andy Wainwright, a Republican State Central Committee member, stated. “There was no finger-pointing. It highlights the bureaucracy and a lot of times the military being handcuffed.”
This election season, voters have never had a clearer choice for president of the United States: Hillary Clinton, the one who abandoned four good men, or Donald Trump, the man who raised $5.6 million for veterans.

Hillary’s campaign is comprised of extremely wealthy elites who exist in an avant-garde world filled with bizarre ritualistic practices that play out like a fantastical plot out of a foreign snuff film.
From pay to play scams designed to make the Clintons wealthy to satanic rituals called Spirit Cooking to accusations of pedophilia and murder – it’s all weaved throughout the Wikileaks email drop like a tapestry of dark and sinister perversion.
In what cold be one the biggest BOMBSHELLS yet, Wikileaks reveals that analysts at an intelligence firm believe that Hillary Clinton had one-time Deputy White House counsel Vince Foster murdered – a rumor that has plagued the Clintons for decades.
Notice the email states that Ron’s assassination had the “earmarks” of Hillary’s “method of disposal…” of a “talkative” secretary of commerce.
Interesting choice of words, wouldn’t you say?
That’s what led to the comment regarding Vince Foster’s murder.
Some may consider that an “off the cuff” comment.
Hardly.
And certainly not happenstance once the totality of the Foster story unfolds.
Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, just outside of Washington, D.C., on July 20, 1993.
His death was ruled a suicide, but new documents call “suicide” into question.
Serious question.
This recently uncovered evidence suggests Vince Foster did not commit suicide.
The evidence shows that he died of two gunshot wounds to the neck, and not the one wound initially reported.
The flies were discovered in the National Archives and Records Administration.
The injuries on Foster’s neck were not reported in official government documents.
At the time, the FBI said that Foster’s neck injury photos were underexposed and useless.
Many people who have studied the case and raised concerns that it was a murder cover up have become targets of Clinton and Clinton associates backlash.
But the facts remain – records indicate Foster didn’t die from one .38 caliber gunshot.
He died from TWO gunshots.
Furthermore, the second shot, on right side of his neck was made by a “small caliber” bullet hole.
This raises serious questions about Foster’s motives for suicide.
He was tied to Hillary Clinton’s roles in White House scandals at Whitewater and the White House Travel Office.
Vince Foster was one of Hillary’s closest friends, and he had intimate knowledge of these two scandals.
The theory is that Vince Foster was murdered to make sure he didn’t tell the world what he knew about President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary.
He has a reputation of being too honest, and therefore, many speculate he could no longer be trusted.
This is just ANOTHER scandal in a decades-long history of scams, secrets, and rumors or sinister wrongdoing, unethical actions, and morally corrupt behavior that follows the Clintons.
America, for the love of everything HOLY – do not welcome further corruption and degradation into the White House.
We’ve gone decades now placing unscrupulous people in power.
It’s time for REAL CHANGE.
It’s time to out an END TO THE CLINTONS.
It’s time for you and me to come first.

http://endingthefed.com/leaked-email-reveals-hillary-faked-surprise-during-tv-interview-whole-thing-scripted-by-campaign.html,Leaked email reveals Hillary faked surprise during TV interview; whole thing scripted by campaign,"Hillary Clinton is legendary for the control she exerts over media opportunities and nowhere was that more apparent than in a recent appearance on “The Steve Harvey Show.”
The Democratic nominee’s campaign took advantage of perennial nice guy Steve Harvey to the extent of helping write the show’s script, according to The Washington Free Beacon.
An internal campaign email sent to Clinton on Feb. 17, 2016, by aides, found attached to an email posted on the website DCLeaks.com, exposed the campaign’s heavy hand.
“Steve [Harvey] is known to be a host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable,” wrote campaign spokeswoman Karen Finney and communications aide Betsaida Alcantara. “We coordinated closely with the show’s producers on the script and format of the show.”
The communique was sent one week before Clinton’s appearance.
More From the Free Beacon:
The campaign memo reveals that Clinton’s staff worked with Harvey to craft the structure of the interview, and briefed the Democratic presidential nominee ahead of time on the precise wording of Harvey’s questions.
The questions touched on Clinton’s granddaughter, her preference for deep dish or thin crust pizza, her campaign’s “great start,” efforts to bridge America’s racial divide, and her support for gun control policies.
According to the memo, Clinton’s staff saw Harvey’s show as an effective and low-risk way to reach out to female and African-American voters. They also noted recent episodes of the show that focused on issues that Clinton had stressed during her campaign.
In a show of just how duplicitous Clinton can be, she feigned surprise throughout the interview, despite knowing ahead of time what was coming.
The campaign and the show’s producers also agreed ahead of time on the structure of a segment that would explore Clinton’s biography and achievements.
“During this segment Steve will take a trip down memory lane with YOU to talk about the different moments of YOUR life displayed in the photographs below,” the memo explained photos of Clinton that Harvey pulled up on screen as she discussed her childhood, education, relationship with her husband, and election to the U.S. Senate.
Yet, as seen in the clip below, a fraudulent Clinton expressed “surprise” when Harvey displayed a photo of her at 12 years old.
“Oh boy!” the candidate said. “Oh my goodness.”

“Durable Adult Diapers” These bizarre search words seem to indicate that something is not right with Hillary Clinton. WIKILEAKS’ hackers managed to hack themselves into Hillary’s private browser on one of her on-trail laptops. And if that is in turn true, Clinton’s presidential fitness will come under extreme scrutiny. She’s absolutely finished. The presidential race is nearing its crescendo.
This afternoon, WIKILEAKS, the truth-seeking renegade web-organisation that leak private and classified information onto their website, published an astonishing find that will no doubt “soil” the public’s’ opinion of Hillary Clinton. Does Hillary have trouble holding it in? Sure, we might all be curious about the fact that some adults wear diapers for various reasons and do a Google search on it just to take a gander, but the fact that Clinton includes the adjective “durable” in her search seems to suggest that she’s actually shopping around for adult diapers.
They extracted the search history for the past two months and released them in a data-dump on their website. Here is the most disturbing search that was extracted. If this is indeed the case, which it might very well be, then Hillary is probably suffering from serious medical conditions and possibly even degenerative mental conditions such as dementia.
Everyday, more dirt on each candidate seems to seep out into the ether and perhaps momentarily sway the opinions of the “unwashed” masses. Julian Assange, the Australian leader of WIKILEAKS has in past months threatened to release information on Hillary, and has done so sporadically, but now he has truly issued his Trump card.
Whatever medical condition she has that causes her to be in need of this type of item, is bound to be debilitating to the body and perhaps also the mind. She will not last this. Some of the Google queries are ordinary and what you would expect from a presidential candidate such as “DNC convention capacity” and of course her own name “Hillary Clinton” which was searched over 1400 times over the period.

http://endingthefed.com/chinese-billionaire-tied-to-clinton-scandal-is-arrested.html,Chinese billionaire tied to Clinton scandal is arrested,"Chinese billionaire tied to 1990s Clinton fundraising scandal arrested for lying about how he used $4.5MILLION cash he brought into the U.S. aboard private jets.
Prominent Macau businessman Ng Lap Seng, who’s worth nearly $2 billion, was arrested Saturday in New York City
The real estate and casino mogul is charged with conspiracy to obstruct and making false statements
In 1998, a Senate committee reported Ng sent over $1M to an Arkansas, restaurateur who contributed hundreds of thousands the DNC
Seng visited the White House 10 times from 1994 to 1996 and had his photograph taken with President Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton
One of the world’s wealthiest people – a Chinese real estate mogul at the center of a Democratic campaign fundraising scandal two decades ago – has been grounded from his fleet of private planes and stripped of his $200,000 watch after his incarceration without bail as the United States probes what he did with millions of dollars he brought into the country over the past few years.
Federal authorities have charged Ng Lap Seng, 68, with lying about his plans for $4.5 million in cash he brought into the U.S. over several years aboard private jets. They say they followed him enough to know he wasn’t spending the cash at casinos, on art and antiques or on real estate, despite his claims to the contrary.
His lawyer, Kevin Tung, has argued that a criminal complaint charging Seng with conspiring to obstruct and making false statements to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is based on a misunderstanding.
‘If you look at this complaint on its face, people carrying money in or out without filling out a form, maybe in violation of something, but this is not really a crime,’ he said. ‘The United States tries to portray this man as a very, very rich man. But I don’t think that has any relevance here.’
He added: ‘People do not know when they’re coming to this country if they carry some cash, there might be a problem.’
In 1998, a Senate committee reported Ng sent over $1.1 million to a one-time Little Rock, Arkansas, restaurant owner, who contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic National Committee and later pleaded guilty to a felony. Seng visited the White House 10 times from 1994 to 1996 and had his photograph taken with President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Incarcerated since Saturday, Seng failed to convince a magistrate judge Monday that he would return to court if released. According to court papers, Seng heads a major real estate development company in Macau, China.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn rejected a request that Seng be released on bail secured by his $3.8 million Manhattan apartment and electronic monitoring.
‘Obviously, being wealthy is not in and of itself, a crime, and I don’t think anybody is accusing your client of criminal activity merely because of his wealth,’ she said.
The judge commented after Assistant U.S. Attorney Janis Echenberg made Seng’s wealth a focal point of her argument against bail.
Echenberg said Seng had reported a net worth of $1.8 billion, including $300 million in annual earnings, $1 billion in Chinese real estate, a $30 million fleet of private jets and a gold watch with diamonds that had been estimated to be worth $200,000.
The prosecutor said Seng, who has passports from China, Portugal and the Dominican Republic, was also a flight risk because he has access to $20 million in U.S. currency that he has wired into the country, ‘tremendous international ties without any real ties to the United States’ and he stopped coming to the United States between 1996 and 2000 when Congress was looking into the fundraising scandal.
According to court papers, Seng was also served in July 2014 with a subpoena to appear Sept. 17, 2014, in connection with an unrelated investigation. But he did not show up.
Besides Seng, his chief assistant was arrested on the same charges. He also remained incarcerated Thursday.
Tung said in an email Thursday that he might try again to get his client released on bail.

http://endingthefed.com/obama-to-blacks-i-will-consider-it-a-personal-insult-if-you-dont-vote-for-hillary.html,Obama to blacks: ‘I will consider it a personal insult’ if you don’t vote for Hillary,"This is what desperation looks like.
President Obama took the stage Saturday night to speak to the Congressional Black Caucus and beseeched the black community to vote for Hillary Clinton in November.
“We have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community. I will consider it a personal insult and an insult to my legacy if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,” he told the crowd. “You want to give me a good send-off? Go vote.”
Clinton holds a sizeable lead over Trump with black voters at 80 percent, according to a recent Washington post report, but it pales in comparison to Obama’s 93 percent support against Mitt Romney in 2012.
And the support of 80 percent won’t do Clinton any good if those voters aren’t energized to go vote for her.
“If you care about our legacy, realize everything we stand for is at stake. All the progress we’ve made is at stake in this election.
“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now,” Obama continued. “And there is one candidate who will advance those things, and there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we’ve done. There’s no such thing as a vote that doesn’t matter, it all matters.”
Clinton herself gave a doom and gloom warning of what would happen under a Trump presidency while promising to continue Obama’s legacy.
“We need ideas not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia,” Clinton said. “We can’t let Barack Obama’s legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn’t understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards.”
The Republican National Committee seized on Clinton presenting herself, essentially, as Obama’s third term.
“Hillary Clinton only represents more of the same stale Democrat policies which have failed black Americans for decades. Over the past eight years, black youth unemployment is up and paychecks are flat, but Hillary Clinton is merely rehashing an agenda that has moved America further away from prosperity for all,” it said in a statement. “Donald Trump is putting forth new ideas that will generate millions of good jobs, deliver school choice, and put the American people first once again. Our Party is committed to fighting for the black vote and giving every American an opportunity to achieve their dreams.”

http://endingthefed.com/fbi-insider-leaks-all-clinton-foundation-exposed-involves-entire-us-government.html,FBI Insider Leaks All: Clinton Foundation Exposed! Involves Entire US Government!,"A thread on 4chan with an FBI insider confirms everyone’s worst suspicions. The Hillary Clinton email server was merely a distraction from the Clinton Foundation and most of DC is in up to their necks in what could be the biggest scandal of all times. This inside info from someone claiming to be a high level FBI analyst whose job was to look at the records, with NOTES added to clarify some of the responses all this and more has been reveled and reported by Before Its News.
The smoking gun is about to arrive and there are “a lot of people involved”. To save everyone time, here are the choice bits with the link to the entire archive, where you can decide for yourself if this is for real or not. Looks like Trump and Putin hold some of the cards. This could be the most interesting election ever. (Lanugauge Warning):
his level of corruption is something expected in a developing country or a place like China, where they openly persecute good people and have industrial scale organ harvesting of Falun Gong and others. The Clinton Foundation is up to their neck with Jiang’s vile regime in China, but there is so much to see here.
Original thread archived at archive.is: http://archive.is/RffAd#selection-33761.0-33761.121
Why Hillary was Not Indicted
{NOTE: This thread was from BEFORE the announcement by Comey that there would not be any indictment}
>>79481119
There is intense pressure for us not to do so. I am posting from a position of near anonymity and enough plausible deniability to evade prosecution, as we have all been given gag orders.
There is enough for her and the entire government to be brought down. People do not realize how enormous this whole situation actually is. Whether she will be or not depends on how much info about others involved gets out, and there are a lot of people involved.
The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the e-mail server. We received the server from Benghazi, then from the server we found data on the CF. Then we realized the situation is much worse than previously thought.
Super Classified Materials on the Clinton Email Server
>>79481467
She had SAP level programs on her server, which if made public, would literally cause an uprising and possibly foreign declarations of war.
{NOTE: A Special Access Program is an intelligence program classified above top-secret. They are held on closed servers at secret locations. The only way to get one is if you are specifically read on to a program, have a need to know, then you must physically go to a location and pass through several layers of security to even look at the program. A good example in non-classified terms would be the locations and operations of our intelligence operatives around the globe, or our missile silo locations.}
The Clinton Foundation is the Key
The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the e-mail server. We received the server from Benghazi, then from the server we found data on the CF. Then we realized the situation is much worse than previously thought.
{NOTE: This explains why the investigation took so many people and so long}
A Bigger Problem than Hillary
Killing HRC would not cause this problem to go away. The problem is with the Clinton Foundation as I mentioned, which you should just imagine as a massive spider web of connections and money laundering implicating hundreds of high-level people. Though I do not have a high opinion of Hillary, she is just a piece -albeit a big piece – of this massive shitstorm.
>>79481265
Legal is asking preliminary questions about whether or not she has been coached (she has) and setting up the general line of questioning. I am a high level analyst though, so my job is only to look at her records.
>>79482104
The DOJ is most likely looking to save itself. Find everyone involved in the Clinton Foundation, from its donors to its Board of Directors, and imagine they are all implicated.
The ENTIRE Government is Involved
>>79482245
My opinion is the entire government is guilty of treason, which is why HRC’s death would not cease the investigation or prevent further scandals. Many, many people are involved.
>>79482342
There already is enough to indict. Comey has been trying to stall because he does not want to face the Clinton Machine, as well as the rest of Washington D.C. But this case would explode into a million other cases if fully brought to light, and then we would be one agency competing against the entire government and a hoard of other interests. It is a very tense and uncomfortable position.
What Lynch is saying is she will accept whatever they do and make her determination as she will. Nothing about her responsibilities has changed, she is simply trying to keep her hide intact.
Foreign Powers Have Some of the Documents
Trump Has Some of the Documents
Russia Will Probably Leak All Info they Have
>>79483349
Foreign powers are in possession of some of the documents we have analyzed, because they were hacked from the Clinton server. Trump has some files as well, and likely plans to leak them and use them to his advantage soon.
The leaks will have to be made in a non-transparent fashion.
>>79483350
If we recommend, we literally hand over documentation implying the entire government is involved in treason at the highest levels and everyone is about to duck and cover, as well as some sensitive details of SAPs which would obliterate national security.
>>79483587
I am not sure, but some of my war strategy buddies are estimating a high probability that Russia will leak all of the info they have to the world, since Clinton wants to go to war with them and they have no desire to be in conflict with the US.
>>79483751
If we do not recommend, it will look like a cover-up and Trump will use the perception to bolster his message. I did work in PsyOps once, and Trump’s use of confirmation bias is legendary.
Bill Clinton Will Likely Die This Year
If Trump Wins, Hillary Goes to Jail
>>79484201
Bill Clinton will likely die this year.
Everything is Corrupt, Even Trump is Dirty
>>79484305
Impossible to say. The entire government is corrupt. No one is clean, not even Trump.
>>79484534
Trump has donated to the Clinton Foundation in the past, though for fairly innocuous things like building permits and such. He is smart, so his tracks are covered well. But if any prosecutor wants to go very in-depth Trump would be brought on bribery charges. He could easily get out of them, but he would be charged nonetheless.
>>79484664
We have our hands tied. My message to you and everyone on this board is do not get distracted by Clinton’s e-mails. Focus on the Foundation. All of the nightmarish truth is there. The e-mails will pale in comparison.
>>79484759
I do not know of Trump’s record, but from the case he definitely knew to limit his exposure and make it only look like a donation.
>>79484907
If Trump wins, HRC will be prosecuted. I have heard rumors Christie will be his AG, and Michael Flynn will be his VP pick.
A Multitude of Scandals
>>79485031
Saudi Arabia visits and donations to the CF. Russian Uranium fiasco. HRC and the Israel lobby, the Council on Foreign Relations. AIPAC. The list is endless.
Three Choices – Could Crash Everything
>>79485572
I will put it to you this way: You have three choices,
A) turn over all of the information to the DOJ, make public a recommendation, the truth comes out, the entire world realizes how much the US is meddling in foreign affairs and we go to war, the civilian population realizes how much foreign money influences our government, and a civil war begins.
B) You cherry-pick the data to implicate the people already in the eye of public opinion, so the chips fall on the heads of a select few and the whole system does not crash.
C) you do nothing and watch the unstable political climate to gauge how you will respond.
I am confident if Trump wins she will be going to jail.
The Problem is the Entire Government
>>79485629
Comey will likely resign in any case. FBI is being very quiet for a reason, most of us want to keep our jobs.
>>79485655
Snowden has nothing to do with any of this.
>>79485706
Possibly. I don’t know for sure.
>>79485756
Obama and HRC do hate each other. HRC hates black people and Obama dislikes recklessness. As far as the investigation, some details are correct. As to the outcome, no one knows.
>>79485779
Truthfully, not many. The FBI is rather fond of /pol/. We study more than we investigate.
The problem is with the entire government. HRC is one component of that government.
Hillary Sold SAP’s to Overseas “Donors”
>>79486178
All I can tell you about the SAPs is HRC had them, and she did not have proper authority to have any of them. They were leaked to her by someone, and she did sell them to overseas donors. Possessing them alone makes her guilty of treason.
Obama is loosely tied to the CF, but much more tied in with the same people who donate to the CF.
>>79486240
Russian borders, Ukraine, everywhere NATO is, the South China Sea, the Phillipines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Africa.
Soros is at the heart of all of this.
>>79486254
If it comes down to it, I would fight. But most of us are of the opinion that HRC will not be president, and having Trump in office makes our job that much easier. But right now we have to carefully wade through the mud.
>>79486263
As I stated before, BC likely wanted LL to focus on the e-mail server and shy away from prosecuting the foundation.
>>79486289
We will go to war with Russia and possibly China if she wins.
Obama Wanted to Postpone the Case Until 2018
>>79483056
Didn’t Obama push to have the case postponed until 2018 as well?
>>79486562
There is talk of it. I do not know where the order came from.
A Difficult Position for FBI Insiders
>>79487155
If leaking data en mass destroys my country, we betray the country. If we do nothing, we betray the country. I am not disagreeing with you. I am saying the situation is more complicated when you are inside, and you do not have the breadth of info that I have that would make your eyes fall out of your skull if you knew what all was going on.
>>79487691
It benefits her because her donors have paid for it. I do not want to post any information about me or where I am, because if any hint got out that I posted anything, I would be fired and blacklisted. Possibly killed.
Soros Guiding Everything – Global Government
>>79488021
Soros funds, instructs, and influences every layer of US government. right down to the tax code.
Correct theories: Huge Jewish influence, Soros as a puppet master, red team planner. You would have to ask specifically.
>>79490049
The goal (of Soros, since I assume that is what you are asking) is to create a global government where all people intermingle and breed and become on people ruled by a racially pure Jewish race. They sincerely believe under their rule all human conflict will cease because there will be no more cause for division. This desire is born out of a fear of the horrors of WWII. The Holocaust is a lie, but the death toll was still massive nonetheless. And many people were brutalized by it.
Russia Hacked the Clinton Email Server 100%
do russia (or others) have enough info to bring down clinton if they leaked it? would they be more likely to leak it or use it for blackmail?
>>79490064
They have enough to take her down. I am not sure of the totality of what they have. I can tell you that they 100% hacked her server.
Orlando and LA Gay Parade Attacks were Inside Jobs
>>79490062
are the incidents manufactured with the intent of harsher gun control laws?
If Everything is Exposed, Human Trafficking and all the Payoffs
>>79490632
>In regards to the Clinton Foundation, what would happen if all of this information ended up being released to the general public?
I said in the last thread, total chaos. The government would be exposed at every layer, who pays who, who buys what, and no one has yet asked about the human trafficking bits I have been laying out.
>What if you, you personally, leaked all the documents to the darkweb or some other online outlet. What would happen?
Silencing and/or death. Some places are trying to leak but we censor them too fast.
>Would the countries that would be named in the documentation declare war if there was a large change in government?
No, they would declare war because all of our secret operations in their countries would be exposed.
>Couldn’t you have the AGs of some of the right aligned states indict her? If they were given enough information and documentation?
We have thought about this. It is on the table.
9/11 Was a Mossad Inside Job
Get Smarter About Civil War (The FBI’s Main Concern)
>>79490926
If a civil war broke out, 100% certainty China and Russia would get involved.
>Also, what fears would need to be resolved in order for the FBI to be willing to go nuclear on this bitch and the foundation?
This would be like launching a nuke at NYC. We would hit the target, but we would then be at war with the whole US.
The FBI is facing the entire federal government in this case. It is why we are so quiet.
Sex Rings in All Governments
>>79493354
Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament & Saudi Arabia, and that’s why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.

http://endingthefed.com/fbi-rumors-about-clinton-pedophile-ring-are-true.html,FBI: Rumors About Clinton Pedophile Ring Are True,"Multiple sources within the FBI and NYPD have confirmed Hillary Clinton’s involvement in a massive pedophile ring in Washington DC.
According to experts on Reddit, insiders have recently confirmed rumors that a child sex scandal involving the Clinton’s and their cronies are true and about to become public knowledge.
Reddit.com reports:
It seems that things are about to heat up. We are told that of the 662,871 emails lifted from Anthony Weiner’s computer, 11,112 emails are Huma Abedin’s… and pay to play – including Saudis and Israelis. Meaning Huma was the one Hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via Huma’s computer.
It has been established through many avenues, but mainly through Wikileaks, that the Clinton Foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform pay-to-play games with multiple entities, including foreign nations. Pay-to-play nations include: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine.
Furthermore, we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms ISIS was created by CIA and Israeli Secret Intelligence Service, with help from Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham!
An NYPD insider said the content they viewed did include State Department Top Secret emails. One file was called “Life Insurance”. A second file was titled “DNC Nuclear Arsenal“.
A third file I’m sure Hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled “Intimate”… according to this NYPD insider, this file contained X-rated photos of Huma and Hillary with a teenager.
NYPD detectives were sickened by what they saw, according to our insider, and they had threatened FBI field agents that they would leak this information, if the FBI did not “step up and take off the kid gloves”. At that point, 13 of the FBI agents in NYC were also threatening to leak the information.
As you can imagine, the scandal has the entire Obama Administration in full panic. We are told there are emails that could send Loretta Lynch to prison, as well as Bill and Hillary.
The following information comes straight from an FBI Anonymous source, who is the senior analyst who posted on 4chan in early July of this year:
Jim Comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, thus making his job impossible.
Comey sent a letter to Congress, knowing that ultimately it would expose Loretta Lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to Obama. The State Department is terrified now. Comey has assembled a small team of 40 agents, whom he has declared “The Untouchables” after the famous federal agent Eliot Ness.
Comey has clamped down on all FBI agents and he expects a full-scale war between the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the White House, and the State Department. He has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted. One of the main targets of the probe is the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Among the targets under investigation are John Podesta, Huma, Cheryl Mills, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc.
As it turns out, Weiner, Huma’s husband, had been forwarding Huma’s emails each time she came home and left her computer open. Huma appears to have been in touch with Saudi actors, and therefore, espionage is strongly suspected.
Comey and his 40 “Untouchables” are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in American history… which is what I think must happen if Comey is planning to stay part of the FBI. He lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first Hillary investigation, it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again.
The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call “creatives“. Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301, which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe.

http://endingthefed.com/6-republicans-who-took-secret-payments-from-clinton-to-destroy-trump-all-new-wiki-leak.html,6 Republicans Who Took Secret Payments From Clinton To Destroy Trump (All-New Wiki Leak),"Every day the job of President-Elect seems to become more danger-filled for Donald Trump. It can honestly be said that it looks like the entire establishment is out to destroy his presidency before it even gets off the ground. As we have said for months, all signs are pointing to Hillary Clinton working behind the scenes on this coup.
Today’s revelation is nothing less than a bombshell in the swamp that is D.C., where we see the curtains pulled back. Here, the real tragedy begins, and new evidence has emerged that shows that despite their public differences, both parties are largely different shades of the same corrupt mud.
New information from Wikileaks is about to shake up the political world. Republicans in name only, anyway. An email from John Podesta to Huma Abedin that was released as document number 1078645 is about to turn the speculation that certain prominent Republicans who opposed Donald Trump into the truth that they were, in fact, not just disloyal to Trump and the party but were on Hillary Clinton’s payroll.
The email, sent in July of this year, describes how funds were being diverted from Clinton’s campaign to the Super PACS of Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, and John Kasich.
According to the email:
“JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign. Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.”
Other emails that surfaced but do not refer to anything other than title have also surfaced that raised eyebrowS. It seems at a glance that the Clinton Foundation, or as I am calling it, the Pantsuit Mafia, has bought off several key members of the Republican Party to push the Clinton agenda. Such as:
“He is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only.”
This email was dated days before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan withdrew the invitation to Donald Trump to speak at an event in Wisconsin. Even though we do not have the ‘smoking gun’ to say it was him, no other logical conclusion can be assumed.
Other emails hint at the money being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For instance FEC reports shows that two large donations from PACS and private sources ln early October went to John McCain right after he attacked Trump publicly criticized Trump. That happened shortly after a slew of emails concerning moving money to support one candidate and move support from another.
Shortly thereafter, his challenger in this tight race, Kirkpatrick, lost several key donors and money and support lessened from the DNC and the DSCC in the last few weeks of the race. The thing to note is that McCain is one of the lead sponsors of a committee to investigate any Russian influence into the election.
Senator Lindsay Graham, another outspoken critic of Donald Trump and briefly candidate for President from July to December also it seems received help from the Clintons. An email that simply states, “Cleared the road for him in 2020,” could mean that there will be no strong or supported Democrat in the South Carolina Senate race when Graham is up for re-election.
As with McCain, Graham has publicly called for a look into the Russian influence in the election.
There were a lot of politicians who were opposed to Donald Trump. These, in particular, all share a common bond, however: Trump humiliated them on stage in front of hundreds of millions of people around the world. This is more than just politics or conscientious objecting, this was revenge.
Not just revenge. This is out and out treason. Our representatives took an oath to support our Constitution and its laws for our benefit, not theirs. This is why gridlock is prevalent in D.C., the treachery and the corruption are on both sides of the coin.
Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing who the true Republicans are and who are the ones that are fronts for the Clinton machine, the Pantsuit Mafia. The number of emails is too overwhelming to easily sift through them all to find all of the turncoat RINOs. We must be diligent to ferret out those that have sold their souls for power.
The only hope that we have for transparency of the Clintons anytime soon rests in an audit carried out by the IRS.
Behold, in recent days, there is a call to impeach the Commissioner of the IRS. Interesting times we live in to be sure. Only time and work on our part will push this audit forward.
Even though Hillary lost the Presidency, she is still a power behind the scenes with these revelations. With her Democratic allies in Pelosi and Schumer and her Republican lackeys in the form of Ryan and other Republicans, she will set the agenda and pull the strings. We the people will have no idea who is on our side and who is not.
For the Clintons, it will mean that even though the American people are supporting Trump and making America great again, they will set the agenda. We will be left scratching our heads and wondering how the GOP and Trump cannot accomplish anything. Clinton will be in control without having to ever show her hand or be responsible to the people.
The Soros-Clinton team will have killed the Republic and we will never know until it is too late.
This Russian news story perhaps is the ultimate coup for the Clinton Camp. She does not even have to be the winner of the Electoral College vote to have gained power. Should enough electors defect to Hillary or name another candidate in their votes (Electors are NOT legally bound to vote for their candidate), then that could throw the vote into the House and Senate.
The suspicious part of this simply is this, On January 20th a new president will be inaugurated. The Constitution in the 25th Amendment spells out the line of succession if there is still not a picked President, the Vice President shall become president (Kaine or Pence).
If the Senate has not picked a Vice-President by noon on the 20th, the Speaker of the House shall become President. Coincidence?
The Roman Republic lasted for centuries in the hands of the people before falling to become the Roman Empire. That change did not happen by a foreign invasion or foreign intrigue. No barbarian or forceful enemy defeated that Republic over 2000 years ago.
It was defeated from the inside by the treachery of the Senate and the blood of the slain Julius Caesar. Just as Caesar was stabbed in the back by men he thought were his allies, Trump is facing the same treachery.
In the coming days and months, without our help and diligence, President Trump may also be gasping…..”Et Tu, Paul?”

http://endingthefed.com/breaking-election-fraud-lawsuit-just-filed-against-hillary.html#.WBOf-3KXZL9.twitter,BREAKING – Election FRAUD Lawsuit Just Filed Against Hillary,"Hillary Clinton just got smacked with a major lawsuit… and the timing for her could not be worse.
James O’Keefe of Project Veritas is filing a formal complaint against the DNC and Hillary Clinton, via Breitbart.com.
In an exclusive interview with the news agency, O’Keefe stated, “As the chairman of Project Veritas, our work is financially independent and beholden to nobody. Our work is funded by thousands of contributors, small, medium, and large.”
He continued, “What I have learned about our media – and it’s frightening – is that almost everyone is compromised. Media companies are beholden to stockholders and I have sources that I am trying to get to go on the record to explain that these companies are afraid of reporting this story for fear of political retaliation.”
O’Keefe believes if the American people knew what truly went on behind the scenes in politics, it would change everything about their perception of our system.
If you would like to see the full complaint filed by Project Veritas and James O’Keefe, click here.
The key pieces of information for which the complaint is based can be found in the recent undercover videos his organization released on YouTube earlier this week.
We actually did numerous stories on them here on Angry Patriot and they have been blowing up all over the Internet.
There is little doubt in my opinion that O’Keefe is about to blow the lid off this corruption and turn this election on its ear. My only wish is that he had published these videos earlier in the cycle so that we would be guaranteed enough time for our legal system to do its thing.
But, now that I think about it, had it come out earlier, it would have more than likely already been buried by the mainstream media. With only two weeks to go before election day, the American people really need to sit up and take notice of this case.
O’Keefe has provided solid evidence of a corrupt Democrat party. And while some of the people in these videos have been terminated from their organizations, it is very apparent this has been going on with the approval of the entire party.
This goes to the top, and by that I mean both Obama and Hillary. Many of the people involved in this scandal are known associates of both, with Creamer regularly visiting the White House and sitting across from Obama himself!
Good luck Mr. O’Keefe and know that We the People are standing behind you 100 percent!

http://endingthefed.com/fbi-director-received-millions-from-clinton-foundation-his-brothers-law-firm-does-clintons-taxes.html,"FBI director received millions from Clinton Foundation, his brother’s law firm does Clinton’s taxes","A review of FBI Director James Comey’s professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader — now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton — is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships — all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton — reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.
These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comey’s former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partner’s board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation’s taxes.
Lockheed Martin
When President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers.
But Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year.
Comey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel.
How much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation.
Lockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor. The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010.
According to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010.
In 2010, Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department.
HSBC Holdings
In 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings.
“Mr. Comey’s appointment will be for an initial three-year term which, subject to re-election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting,” according to HSBC company records.
HSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation. For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to “retrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sector” in “New York City.”
“Retrofitting” refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected “$1 billion in financing” for this Green initiative to conserve people’s energy in low-income housing units.
Who Is Peter Comey?
When our source called the Chinatown offices of D.C. law firm DLA Piper and asked for “Peter Comey,” a receptionist immediately put him through to Comey’s direct line. But Peter Comey is not featured on the DLA Piper website.
Peter Comey serves as “Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas” for DLA Piper. James Comey was not questioned about his relationship with Peter Comey in his confirmation hearing.
DLA Piper is the firm that performed the independent audit of the Clinton Foundation in November during Clinton-World’s first big push to put the email scandal behind them. DLA Piper’s employees taken as a whole represent a major Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign donation bloc and Clinton Foundation donation base.
DLA Piper ranks #5 on Hillary Clinton’s all-time career Top Contributors list, just ahead of Goldman Sachs.
And here is another thing: Peter Comey has a mortgage on his house that is owned by his brother James Comey, the FBI director.
Peter Comey’s financial records, obtained by Breitbart News, show that he bought a $950,000 house in Vienna, Virginia, in June 2008. He needed a $712,500 mortgage from First Savings Mortgage Corporation.
But on January 31, 2011, James Comey and his wife stepped in to become Private Party lenders. They granted a mortgage on the house for $711,000. Financial records suggest that Peter Comey took out two such mortgages from his brother that day.
This financial relationship between the Comey brothers began prior to James Comey’s nomination to become director of the FBI.
DLA Piper did not answer any question as to whether James Comey and Peter Comey spoke at any point about this mortgage or anything else during the Clinton email investigation.

http://endingthefed.com/breaking-news-the-vast-majority-felt-hillary-clinton-should-be-prosecuted-the-senior-fbi-official-told-fox-news.html,BREAKING: The Vast Majority Felt Hillary Clinton Should Be Prosecuted… The Senior FBI Official Told Fox News,"The decision to let Hillary Clinton off the hook for mishandling classified information has roiled the FBI and Department of Justice, with one person closely involved in the year-long probe telling FoxNews.com that career agents and attorneys on the case unanimously believed the Democratic presidential nominee should have been charged.
The source, who spoke to FoxNews.com on the condition of anonymity, said FBI Director James Comey’s dramatic July 5 announcement that he would not recommend to the Attorney General’s office that the former secretary of state be charged left members of the investigative team dismayed and disgusted. More than 100 FBI agents and analysts worked around the clock with six attorneys from the DOJ’s National Security Division, Counter Espionage Section, to investigate the case.
“No trial level attorney agreed, no agent working the case agreed, with the decision not to prosecute — it was a top-down decision,” said the source, whose identity and role in the case has been verified by FoxNews.com.
A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.”
Andrew Napolitano, former judge and senior judicial analyst for Fox News Channel, said many law enforcement agents involved with the Clinton email investigation have similar beliefs.
“It is well known that the FBI agents on the ground, the human beings who did the investigative work, had built an extremely strong case against Hillary Clinton and were furious when the case did not move forward,” said Napolitano. “They believe the decision not to prosecute came from The White House.”
The claim also is backed up by a report in the New York Post this week, which quotes a number of veteran FBI agents saying FBI Director James Comey “has permanently damaged the bureau’s reputation for uncompromising investigations with his cowardly whitewash of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information using an unauthorized private email server.”
“The FBI has politicized itself, and its reputation will suffer for a long time. I hold Director Comey responsible,” Dennis V. Hughes, the first chief of the FBI’s computer investigations unit, told the Post. Retired FBI agent Michael M. Biasello added to the report, saying, “Comey has singlehandedly ruined the reputation of the organization.”
Especially angering the team, which painstakingly pieced together deleted emails and interviewed witnesses to prove that sensitive information was left unprotected, was the fact that Comey based his decision on a conclusion that a recommendation to charge would not be followed by DOJ prosecutors, even though the bureau’s role was merely to advise, Fox News was told.
“Basically, James Comey hijacked the DOJ’s role by saying ‘no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case,’” the Fox News source said. “The FBI does not decide who to prosecute and when, that is the sole province of a prosecutor — that never happens.
“I know zero prosecutors in the DOJ’s National Security Division who would not have taken the case to a grand jury,” the source added. “One was never even convened.”
Napolitano agreed, saying the FBI investigation was hampered from the beginning, because there was no grand jury, and no search warrants or subpoenas issued.
“The FBI could not seize anything related to the investigation, only request things. As an example, in order to get the laptop, they had to agree to grant immunity,” Napolitano said.
In early 2015, it was revealed that Clinton had used a private email server in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home to conduct government business while serving from 2009-2013. The emails on the private server included thousands of messages that would later be marked classified by the State Department retroactively. Federal law makes it a crime for a government employee to possess classified information in an unsecure manner, and the relevant statute does not require a finding of intent.
Although Comey found that Clinton was “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” he said “no charges are appropriate in this case.”
Well before Comey’s announcement, which came days after Bill Clinton met in secret with Comey’s boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, there were signs the investigation would go nowhere, the source told FoxNews.com. One was the fact that the FBI forced its agents and analysts involved in the case to sign non-disclosure agreements.
“This is unheard of, because of the stifling nature it has on the investigative process,” the source said.
Another oddity was the five so-called immunity agreements granted to Clinton’s State Department aides and IT experts.
Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s former chief of staff, along with two other State Department staffers, John Bentel and Heather Samuelson, were afforded immunity agreements, as was Bryan Pagliano, Clinton’s former IT aide, and Paul Combetta, an employee at Platte River networks, the firm hired to manage her server after she left the State Department.
As Fox News has reported, Combetta utilized the computer program “Bleachbit” to destroy Clinton’s records, despite an order from Congress to preserve them, and Samuelson also destroyed Clinton’s emails. Pagliano established the system that illegally transferred classified and top secret information to Clinton’s private server. Mills disclosed classified information to the Clinton’s family foundation in the process, breaking federal laws.
None should have been granted immunity if no charges were being brought, the source said.
“[Immunity] is issued because you know someone possesses evidence you need to charge the target, and you almost always know what it is they possess,” the source said. “That’s why you give immunity.”
Mills and Samuelson also received immunity for what was found on their computers, which were then destroyed as a part of negotiations with the FBI.
“Mills and Samuelson receiving immunity with the agreement their laptops would be destroyed by the FBI afterwards is, in itself, illegal,” the source said. “We know those laptops contained classified information. That’s also illegal, and they got a pass.”
Mills’ dual role as Clinton’s attorney and a witness in her own right should never have been tolerated either.
“Mills was allowed to sit in on the interview of Clinton as her lawyer. That’s absurd. Someone who is supposedly cooperating against the target of an investigation [being] permitted to sit by the target as counsel violates any semblance of ethical responsibility,” the source said.
“Every agent and attorney I have spoken to is embarrassed and has lost total respect for James Comey and Loretta Lynch,” the source said. “The bar for DOJ is whether the evidence supports a case for charges — it did here. It should have been taken to the grand jury.”
Also infuriating agents, the New York Post reported, was the fact that Clinton’s interview spanned just 3½ hours with no follow-up questioning, despite her “40 bouts of amnesia,” and then, three days later, Comey cleared her of criminal wrongdoing.
Many FBI and DOJ staffers believe Comey and Lynch were motivated by ambition, and not justice, the source said.
“Loretta Lynch simply wants to stay on as Attorney General under Clinton, so there is no way she would indict,” the source said. “James Comey thought his position [excoriating Clinton even as he let her off the hook] gave himself cover to remain on as director regardless of who wins.”
The decision by Comey and Lynch not to prosecute has renewed FBI agents’ belief that the agency should be autonomous.
“This is why so many agents believe the FBI needs to be an entity by itself to truly be effective,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We all feel very strongly about it — and the need to be objective. But that truly cannot be done when the AG is appointed by a president and attends daily briefings.”
Adding to the controversy, WikiLeaks released internal Clinton communication records this week that show the Department of Justice kept Clinton’s campaign and her staff informed about the progress of its investigation.
Leaked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s gmail account show the Clinton campaign was contacted by the DOJ on May 19, 2015.
“DOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge’s thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today,” Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon wrote in relation to the email documentation the State Department would be required to turn over to the Justice Department.
Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, who previously served in the U.S. Treasury Department in the Office of Chief Counsel for the IRS, where he was responsible for litigation in the U.S. Tax Court, said it was clear from the start that the FBI never intended to prosecute.
“This was a fake, false investigation from the outset,” Sekulow said.

http://endingthefed.com/breaking-man-who-leaked-clintons-medical-records-found-dead.html#.V_QfPoibZ98.facebook,BREAKING: Man Who Leaked Clinton’s Medical Records Found Dead,"Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service has issued a report saying that the father of a doctor treating Hillary Clinton for dementia was found killed this weekend after he leaked information about her deteriorating health to the public.
According to the report, Vincent Fleck, the father of Clinton’s physician Dr. Daniel Fleck, was found near his home just 24 hours after releasing Hillary’s most secret medical records to the public.
Whatdoesitmean.com reports:
The SVR first became “alerted/alarmed” regarding the circumstances of this latest mysterious death associated with Hillary Clinton on 17 July, this report says, when a “known/suspected” Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) “hit team” traveled about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from their New York City “base/headquarters” to a small village named Mount Kisco, both being located in New York State.
Upon arriving in Mount Kisco, this report continues, this CIA “hit team” broke into a specialized small computer security companies annex office named Right Click Solutions, located at 322 East Main Street, but were “shocked/surprised” by the unexpected arrival of an off duty employee—who immediately called the local police forces when he noticed the break in—and who were only able to obtain a single laptop computer.
An “electronic interrogation” of this company and its customers to ascertain the CIA’s interest in it, this report says, revealed an anomaly where this computer security company had installed a “Snowden-like dead man’s switch” on the personal computer of man named Vincent Fleck.
In the SVR’s investigation of Vincent Fleck, this report continues, it was discovered that he was the father of Dr. Daniel Fleck—who is the personal physical therapist for Hillary Clinton and whose practice is located in New York City.
While SVR analysts were still investigating this case, this report notes, they received information this past Sunday (7 August) that Vincent Fleck had been reported dead in a mysterious swimming “event” near his home—and that was followed 24 hours later by the leaking to the public of Hillary Clinton’s secret medical reports from a Twitter account named @HillsMedlRecords—and that was nearly immediately shut down.
Prior to this Twitter account being shut down, however, this report continues, its creator was able to state “I hate to do this, but people need to need to know. Dr. Bardack was not honest about Hillary Clinton’s health and I have proof” and release several damaging medical documents—the most damaging being a diagnosis of Hillary Clinton that says she has “Complex Partial Seizures” and “Subcortical Vascular Dementia.”
Still unable to be determined by SVR analysts, this report says, is if this leak was done by Vincent Fleck acting alone, or by his son Dr. Daniel Fleck who was using his father’s computer in the mistaken belief he would not be discovered.
With Hillary Clinton’s health being reported in rapid decline, and her aides having to constantly keep her from falling, this report concludes, the US propaganda mainstream media is now reported to be “strangely silent” about telling the American people how ill she really is with dementia—leaving everyone to wonder if she’ll even be fit for office should she win the presidency.

http://eagnews.org/hillary-inspired-me-14-year-old-demands-middle-school-offer-free-tampons/,‘Hillary inspired me’: 14-year-old demands middle school offer free tampons,"MERCER ISLAND, Wash. – A 14-year-old self-described feminist at Islander Middle School is drawing inspiration from her idol Hillary Clinton to campaign for free tampons in school bathrooms.
Eighth-grader Cordelia Longo had a rough day at school this year when she went to a school bathroom and found it did not have a sanitary napkin/tampon machine. She went to another bathroom that did and paid a dime for her feminine protection, but the machine ate her money, the Seattle Times reports.
She tried again at another machine, which also ate her money, before realizing she had a sanitary napkin in her backpack.
The experience apparently convinced her to launch a campaign for free tampons for all, which her school already provided at the nurses office and locker rooms, NBC News reports.
“I just didn’t want other girls to have to experience this. I just wanted to make people’s lives better – girls’ lives easier,” she told the news site. “They already have to deal with so much and this seemed like something I should fix.”
So she started a petition and got 100 people to sign on to demand officials put free tampons in school bathrooms.
She also sent a letter to administrators that outlined why she doesn’t think it’s fair that girls have to pay a “pink tax” to control their periods.
“Why are tissues and toilet paper provided free at school, but not sanitary pads and tampons?” she questioned in the letter. “As toilet paper and tissue are used for normal bodily functions, sanitary pads and tampons are also necessary to address normal bodily functions that happen naturally. The only difference is that only girls need pads. Girls do not choose to have periods. So girls are being penalized and made to pay for a bodily function they cannot control.”
Next, Longo put together baskets with tampons for her classmates that included quotes from her role model, Hillary Clinton, NBC News reports.
“Women’s rights are human rights,” one of the notes read. “Human rights are women’s rights.”
The teen said she learned how to take action against the corrupt system through her school’s social justice class, which teaches all about oppression, race, gender and other social justice things.
“Hillary Clinton inspired me because she kept being strong and she didn’t take any of the insults people threw at her and didn’t let it affect her,” she said.
“It inspired me in a way that I can’t really describe,” Longo continued. “I realized even if I didn’t succeed in getting equal rights for men and women, that I had tried and all that mattered was that I tried my hardest to get equal access to education.”
Longo’s efforts convinced school officials to fix the broken tampon machines and make the sanitary napkins available to students for free.
Longo said it was a big win for social justice.
“I feel like if we all get together, all of the people who are in favor of social justice and equal access to education, I feel hopeful. I feel satisfied that I created this petition and wrote this letter and made a difference in our school,” she said.
A district spokesperson told NBC News officials are “very proud” of Longo for speaking out about the injustices of broken tampon machines, and “for putting into practice the skills she gained in the social justice class.”
“We have repaired any broken or empty machines and they (no) longer require any coins for feminine hygiene supplies,” the spokesperson said. “Ample supplies are also available in the heath room and locker rooms.”
Islander Co-Principal Mary Jo Budzius told the Times Longo’s social justice crusade is also reverberating to the high school, which will also now offer free tampons for students.

http://www.usanewsinsider.com/george-soros-god-created-everything-control-america-hillary-clinton/,"George Soros: ‘I Am A God, I Created Everything, I Control America And Hillary Clinton’","His god-complex explains so much about George Soros, the billionaire globalist, who uses his powerful influence in every corner of the Earth. Soros has said of himself that “normal rules do not apply” to him and that he is a “self-centered” god.
Much that Soros has done has been with an agenda to sculpt the world into the likeness of his globalist world view. He has influence over heads of state and his Open Societies Foundation has been instrumental in the mass influx of Mulsim immigrants through out Europe and the United States.
Arch socialist globalist and race riot revolution mastermind George Soros emerged to spout an ultimatum to all Europe. Every country must “accept responsibility” for the mass influx of Muslims now flooding the continent.
“The EU needs a comprehensive plan to respond to the crisis, one that reasserts effective governance over the flows of asylum-seekers so that they take place in a safe, orderly way, and at a pace that reflects Europe’s capacity to absorb them. To be comprehensive, the plan has to extend beyond the borders of Europe,” Soros writes.
The plan must be globalist in nature, Soros argues, and led by the United Nations. “This would distribute the burden of the Syrian crisis over a larger number of states, while also establishing global standards for dealing with the problems of forced migration more generally.”
Read how Soros see himself on the next page. The ego on this one is enormous.
George Soros’ god-complex when paired with his ungodly amount of wealth, makes him a nemesis to those who resist his idea of a one-world government. He has been directly involved in many schemes to alter the balance of power and create the world into what he dreams fit.
By funding Soros’ Open Societies Foundation as well as Mr. Soros himself are funding strategies to encourage participation in the electoral process among those groups most likely to vote for leftest candidates. With the added words we have an accuratestatement that exposes Soros’ motives and agenda.
“The following four goals form the scaffolding of U.S. Programs’ work,” the guidestates. “1. An American democracy strengthened through increased meaningful participation, inclusive practice, and accountability.” The third strategic goal expands upon this, calling for “Full political, economic, and civic participation of immigrants and communities of color by dismantling the barriers and strengthening the conduits to opportunity.”
On the world stage, “Globalist George Soros is meddling in the nations around the world, forcing them to take in Muslim refugees, so that the nations will change to fit his brand of the what the world should look like.
Moreover, according to Soros, the Muslim migrants must be allowed to choose where they will settle. Most currently travel to Germany and Western Europe where social benefits are available.
Muslim migration “has been the biggest engine of demographic growth in the EU as a whole since the mid-1990s,” a report issued by the EU’s Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development states. “It is about to become the only one.”
“I fancied myself as some kind of god …” he wrote. “If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood, which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me in trouble.“ When asked by Britain’s Independent newspaper to elaborate on that statement, Soros doubled down: “It is a sort of disease when you consider yourself some kind of god, the creator of everything, but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out.“Since I began to live it out. Those unfamiliar with Soros would probably dismiss that claim as nothing more the typical blathering of an irrelevant madman. But those who have followed his career and sociopolitical endeavors realize that while he may be mad, he is a mad billionaire, and billionaires tend not to be irrelevant.
Soros freely admits he pulls the puppet-strings and holds the purse strings too, by hisaccount, he is “god”.

Mr Clinton, who has been visiting the UK and Ireland, will meet with the Prime Minister in Number 10 on Thursday.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “He and the PM wanted to take this opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland and also the ongoing partnership between the Government and the Clinton Health Access Initiative’s work to lower the cost of HIV/Aids treatment worldwide.”
As president, Mr Clinton played a key role in helping to secure the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which led to power-sharing in Northern Ireland.
Currently the devolved institutions at Stormont remain suspended following collapse of the administration in January in the wake of the resignation of the late Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister.
During his visit to Northern Ireland, Mr Clinton met privately with the leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein, the two biggest parties in the assembly.
Mrs May’s spokesman however made clear that he had not been used to deliver a message on behalf of the Government, although efforts to restore power-sharing were continuing.
“Obviously work is ongoing in trying to reach a solution to get the compromises that are necessary to get the devolved administration up and running again,” the spokesman said.

Depending on the outcome of the State Department probe, Crooked Hillary Clinton and her aides could have their security clearances pulled. The fact that Hillary Clinton STILL has access to sensitive government documents shows how broken our system is.
Via Fox News:
The State Department has opened a formal inquiry into whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information while she was the nation’s top diplomat, Fox News has learned. Despite being under investigation, Clinton and her staffers still have security clearances to access sensitive government information.
The department’s investigation aims to determine whether Clinton and her closest aides violated government protocols by using her private server to receive, hold and transmit classified and top-secret government documents. The department declined to say when its inquiry began, but it follows the conclusion of the FBI’s probe into the matter, which did not result in any actions being taken against Clinton or any of her aides.
Depending on the outcome of the current State Department inquiry, Clinton and her aides could have their access to sensitive government documents terminated.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, confirmed to Fox News the department’s formal inquiry.
What is it going to take for Hillary Clinton to lose her security clearance? TGP recently reported on the bombshell email Judicial Watch just discovered where Hillary Clinton admitted she wasn’t supposed to be using her blackberry.
Against the advice of the security hawks, I still do carry my berry but am prohibited from using it in my office, where I spend most of my time when I’m not on a plane or in a “no coverage” country.
Paul Sperry of The New York post also reported on a bombshell report that Hillary Clinton’s Filipino housekeeper was printing up classified documents for her.
As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton routinely asked her maid to print out sensitive government emails and documents — including ones containing classified information — from her house in Washington, DC, emails and FBI memos show. But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material.
In fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive emails that she may hold the secrets to emailgate — if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used.
“Pls ask Marina to print for me in am,” Clinton emailed top aide Huma Abedin regarding a redacted 2011 message marked sensitive but unclassified.
In a classified 2012 email dealing with the new president of Malawi, another Clinton aide, Monica Hanley, advised Clinton, “We can ask Marina to print this.”
“Revisions to the Iran points” was the subject line of a classified April 2012 email to Clinton from Hanley. In it, the text reads, “Marina is trying to print for you.”
Both classified emails were marked “confidential,” the tier below “secret” or “top secret.”
The Daily Caller also compiled a list of ’35 email lies that Hillary Clinton is still telling on her campaign site’ last July. Here are a couple of those lies:
Lie #1 – “We’ve put all the information about Hillary Clinton’s State Department emails here.”
This is the first sentence of the “fact sheet,” and it sets the tone for the rest of the document. The FAQ leaves numerous questions unanswered, as the rest of the Clinton campaign’s responses show.
Lie #2 – “Her usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.”
Clinton’s email habits were not consistent with her predecessors nor was her practice of exclusively using a personal email account permitted. Colin Powell, who served at the beginning of George W. Bush’s term, used a personal AOL account to conduct some government business. But he did not have a private server in the basement of his home. Condoleezza Rice did not use email at all.

Hillary Clinton’s ethics elevator does not have a “main lobby” floor. For her, he it just descends straight into hell.
In other words, she has absolutely no moral compass. She does what it takes to get what she wants and doesn’t care what happens to anyone else along the way.
She claims to be “pro-woman” but her pathetic response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal show that she is quite the opposite.
Former Milwaukee County Sheriff Davide Clarke weighed in on Hillary and her lack of sympathy. He said, “She doesn’t care about those women,” and he is completely right.
Clarke continued, “Her politics matters more to her, the reputation of her husband, to prop him up in the White House for her future political endeavors was more important to her than these victims.”
She cannot pretend to be disgusted by Weinstein now when she not only likely knew about his shady doings, but is also still married to Slick Willy himself! She covered up her husband’s sexual harassment and scared the women into staying silent.
She is a predator, just as much as Bill and Harvey!
Hillary Clinton compared President Trump to disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, whom over two dozen women accused of rape or sexual misconduct.
When asked about her husband Bill Clinton’s accusers, though, Hillary dismissed the claims as already litigated and “clearly in the past.”
Clarke said, “She trashed the reputation of those victims,” and added that believes “Crooked Hillary” is a nickname that fits like a glove.
He continued, “She’s morally bankrupt. Her ethics elevator has no bottom floor, and she will do whatever she has to do to protect herself, her image, and her reputation.”
Women’s groups should come out against Clinton in the wake of this scandal, Clarke continued.
After the Weinstein scandal broke, Clinton took five days to come out against the film producer, who gave almost $50,000 to her presidential campaign

Hillary, Hillary, Hillary…..while most of America is eagerly waiting to see the beautiful image of your face behind bars, you are out promoting a book full of lies.
Imagine if every candidate who lost wrote a book? We could have a library just for their salty, tear filled pages.
Clinton came on with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday night in an attempt, once again, to explain her book and bash Trump. Shocker.
She hopes to “pull the curtain back” and “invite people in to see what happened from my perspective.” Although we kind of already know the answer there: she’s a lying criminal and she lost.
Fox News reports:
She spoke about Election Night and how “devastated” she was by her loss — and how she might have felt better if a Republican other than Donald Trump had defeated her.
“I wouldn’t be so worried about my country and the world as I am now when I see what’s going on every single day,” Clinton said.
The former secretary of state and U.S. senator also criticized the Trump administration’s recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.
“If they aren’t the highest priority of your government in responding to such a terrible natural disaster, what are you people spending your time doing, right? Golfing, tweeting, watching cable TV?,” she said.
Clinton continued to talk about the issues, specifically the recent calls by Democrats, and some Republicans, to tighten gun control laws, following the Las Vegas massacre.
She disgustingly added, , “I can’t believe that one whole political party in the greatest country on Earth is totally sold to the gun lobby and will do whatever they are ordered to do, despite the loss of life.”
We aren’t sold to the gun lobby. Many Conservatives just happen to believe in our 2nd amendment rights. Rights that people like Hillary and Soros would like to rip out from underneath us.
Hillary also tweeted out, before the blood had even dried from the massacre, in a call for gun control. President Donal Trump, and even former President Barack Obama, tweeted out his deepest condolences. While Hillary Tweeted this:
The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots.
Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017
Which has been proven false by Politifact. They said, “a suppressor would not have made a difference” because of “the position of the weapons and because of the distance of the shooter from the crowd.”

https://eaglerising.com/57669/was-andrew-mccabe-the-point-man-in-stopping-the-clinton-email-investigation/,Was Andrew McCabe the Point Man in Stopping the Clinton Email Investigation?,"Andrew McCabe was allegedly the source of TWO different “stand-down orders” regarding the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.
Earlier we wrote about Andrew McCabe’s claim that a State Department official tried the interfere in the Clinton email investigation. One might wonder why Anderw McCabe reported such interference to the inspector general. Perhaps he was trying to make himself look honest and divert suspicion away from himself for his role in obstructing the Clinton email investigation. That doesn’t mean that McCabe’s story is untrue, but people are telling reporters that McCabe himself tried to stop the investigation.
Sara Carter reported, “Did McCabe issue ‘Stand-Down’ order on FBI Clinton Email Investigation?”
Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now facing possible criminal charges for lying under oath about leaks he made to The Wall Street Journal in 2016, in an effort to salvage his reputation and give his account to journalists who were questioning whether he gave a “stand-down” order to FBI agents investigating the Clinton Foundation.
Multiple former FBI officials, along with a Congressional official, say that while there may have been internal squabbling over the FBI’s investigation into the Clinton Foundation at the time, there was allegedly another “stand-down” order by McCabe regarding the opening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of her private email for official government business.
McCabe’s stand-down order regarding Clinton’s private email use happened after The New York Times first reported Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules in March 2015 and before the official investigation was requested by the Justice Department toward the end of July 2015.
After The New York Times publication, the FBI Washington Field Office began investigating Clinton’s use of private emails and whether she was using her personal email account to transmit classified information. According to sources, McCabe was overseas when he became aware of the investigation and sent electronic communications voicing his displeasure with the agents.
“McCabe tried to steer people off the private email investigation and that appears to be obstruction and should be investigated,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the investigation. “Now if the information on the ‘stand-down’ order is obtained by the IG that could bring a whole lot of other troubles to McCabe.”
[…]
The DOJ declined to comment on whether McCabe had given a “stand-down” order in either or both investigations into Clinton. The Inspector General, which is expected to issue its second report in May on the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private server for government business, does not comment on ongoing investigations.

Apparently college universities are just letting anyone teach these days! No, seriously. I think if my dog was a liberal and would say the words, “Trump sucks” then she would be offered a better paying job than I have now.
Which leads me to the laughable reality that Hillary Clinton is eyeing a teaching position at Ivy League Columbia University. If I was a parent of a student there, I would be furious. In my opinion, her employment there would completely discredit any ounce of respectability that the school has.
Clinton failed at winning the presidential election, and her book explaining why she failed, also flopped. So now she is plotting her next move.
What will the punishment be for having an opinion different from hers in an assignment? Will they spontaneously commit “suicide” or….
Breitbart reports:
The New York Daily News reports that Clinton is in discussions for a flexible role that would allow the former secretary of state to lecture across schools and departments without the requirement of a strict course.
Clinton has the background for it, as a former law professor at the Arkansas School of Law, but a source “with knowledge of Clinton’s thinking” told the Daily News that “no decisions have been made, but there are talks.”
Clinton is also reportedly in discussions to house her archives at the prestigious university.
At one point, reports surfaced that Clinton was looking into becoming a Methodist preacher. According to her pastor, Bill Shillady, “I think it would be more of … her guest preaching at some point,” he continued, “We have a long history of lay preachers in the United Methodist Church.”
This is actually extremely ironic to me….that Hillary goes to church, I mean. Does she burst into flames when he enters the church? I mean, she certainly isn’t a Christian. Last time I checked, the bible looks down upon lying and murder.

The truth has a funny way of coming out, even if it takes a while.
Former FBI Director James Comey is back in hot water after the FBI confirmed a little detail regarding Comey’s investigation of Hillary Clinton: Comey drafted a letter to exonerate Clinton months before he even interviewed her!
This means that he had already made up his mind on her “innocence” before he even questioned her about the overwhelming about of evidence showing her crimes. Now the question is, why?
The FBI released a document called, “Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”
Fox News reports:
The contents of the email were largely unclear as nearly all of it was redacted. The now-public records show the email titled “Midyear Exam — UNCLASSIFIED” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016, to Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, general counsel James Baker and chief of staff and senior counselor James Rybicki.
On May 16, the documents showed a response email from Rybicki, saying “Please send me any comments on this statement so we may roll into a master doc for discussion with the Director at a future date. Thanks, Jim.”
The existence of the documents, reported by Newsweek, were first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also a member of the committee, after they reviewed transcripts of interviews with top Comey aides who alluded to the email’s existence. The Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating Comey in his role as FBI director and President Trump’s decision to fire him in May.
The two senators set out to contact the new FBI director, Christopher Wray. On August 30, they wrote a letter to Wray explaining their discover and added, ““[I]t appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work,” their letter continued, “The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts.”
Daily Wire reports:
The existence of documents that prove that Comey drafted the letter exonerating Clinton before he even questioned her calls into question his Senate testimony in June, at which he said he was told by Attorney General Loretta Lynch not to refer to the criminal investigation into Clinton as an investigation, but as a “matter.”
Graham told Fox News in September that he will subpoena Comey if he has to in order to get him to return to Capitol Hill to answer more questions surrounding the investigation.
Graham said “We now know that he had made up his mind to exonerate her before he even interviewed her, which is a bit odd,” she continued, “I’m very suspicious of the timing. I’m very suspicious of the reason.”
House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy also spoke out about the the absurdity of the issue as well.
Gowdy said that it is “beyond dispute that he made up his mind not to charge Secretary Clinton before he interviewed her,” and that “he may well have made up his mind before he interviewed the last dozen witnesses.”
“There’s sufficient factual basis to bring him in and ask him, ‘when did you make up your mind that you were not going to charge Secretary Clinton?’” Gowdy concluded.

On account of Wikileaks and the Intercept, truth be told, we now have a rundown of no under 65 standard “columnists” whose crusade scope constitutes purposeful publicity for the Clinton battle — and no big surprise, considering the revoltingly unbalanced hot air displayed by their outlets.
As (real) columnists Glenn Greenwald and Lee Fang provided details regarding October 9, the Intercept only got reports gotten by the source known as Guccifer 2.0 confirming Clinton battle strategies to court writers depicting the previous secretary of state in a positive light.
“As these inner records illustrate,” the Intercept announced, “a focal part of the Clinton battle system is guaranteeing that writers they accept are ideal to Clinton are entrusted to report the stories the crusade needs coursed.
“On occasion, Clinton’s battle staff not just inside drafted the stories they needed distributed however even determined what ought to be cited ‘on foundation’ and what ought to be depicted as ‘on the record.'”
One interior technique record dated January 2015 — months before Clinton authoritatively commenced her crusade in April — with the inquisitive heading “Earned Media/Next Steps” uncovered how the battle made a yet occasional routine with regards to making assumed news pieces from starting to culmination.
Under the — not in the slightest degree sideways affront to the essentials of reporting — heading “Setting a Story,” the reminder’s creator composed:
“As we talked about on our call, we are all in assention that the time is correct [to] put a story with a well disposed columnist in the coming days that positions us somewhat more straightforwardly while accomplishing the above objectives.”
Particularly named as a recommended columnist plant is Maggie Haberman of Politico, whom they note will help with doing “the most molding” of the account they have as a primary concern.
Haberman, be that as it may, is a long way from the main star Clinton media shill. As the Intercept noticed, a survey of the metadata for one of the got reports discovered it had been penned by crusade correspondences executive, Jennifer Palmieri — who made a rundown of apparent savants and columnists possibly amiable to focusing with the ace Clinton message.
The Intercept likewise uncovered a R.S.V.P. rundown of 38 media friendlies welcomed to a pre-crusade declaration soiree with ‘top battle associates’ at the home of strategist Joel Benenson a year ago on April 10, which was “a completely confidentially assembling intended to bestow the battle’s informing.”
Despite the fact that the outlets they spoke to obviously included left-inclining MSNBC, Huffington Post, and Politico, the rundown additionally incorporates writers from the Daily Beast, Vice, Vox, The New Yorker, and even People Magazine.
In the Wikileaks archive, the genuine extent of Clinton battle skulduggery is uncovered in another long list if people to attend for a parallel capacity facilitated by Mr. Spilled Emails, himself, John Podesta, on April 9 a year ago.
Squeeze secretary Jesse Ferguson — who composed both records — kept in touch with the top colleagues:
“Here is the current RSVP rundown to the Thursday Night (4/9) supper at Podesta’s. As an update, this is with the 25 journalists all the more firmly taking after HRC (otherwise known as the future transport).”
Despite the fact that the arrangement between the media and both the Clinton crusade and Democratic National Committee has generous streamed out on account of spilled archives from Wikileaks and others, these arrangements of named columnists willing to go too far amongst news coverage and battling are despicable — if not accommodating instruments to know with conviction whose announcing is refuse.

https://en-volve.com/2018/05/02/breaking-a-second-russia-dossier-exists-the-author-was-hired-and-directed-by-clinton/,BREAKING: A SECOND RUSSIA DOSSIER EXISTS! The Author Was Hired And Directed By Clinton,"Share
Clinton operatives pushed a dossier during the 2016 presidential campaign that appeared to be a classic “rope-a-dope” scheme being peddled by purported Russian spies, according to a person who was briefed on the documents by one of the Clinton insiders during the campaign.
The dossier in question was written by Cody Shearer, a notorious Clinton fixer. It was passed to the Department of State by Sidney Blumenthal, a friend of Shearer’s and another Clinton operative.
The eight-page document eventually made its way to the FBI through Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote a dossier of his own.
While the FBI is reportedly investigating the claims made in the Shearer memos, one person who discussed the document with Shearer during the campaign says it appeared at the time to be a ruse.
According to the source, who spoke to The Daily Caller News Foundation on condition of anonymity, Shearer claimed that members of Russia’s spy service, the FSB, had videotape of Trump engaged in sexually compromising acts.
That allegation was similar to the one contained in Steele’s dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Steele, a former MI6 officer, cited a source who said that the Kremlin has video of Trump in a Moscow hotel room in 2013 with prostitutes. The Russian government was blackmailing Trump with the footage, Steele alleged.
Shearer said he did not have the supposed tapes, TheDCNF’s source said, adding that Shearer’s situation sounded like a “rope-a-dope story where the FSB throws this stuff out there, sucks people in, tries to get money.”
A U.S. government official who was briefed on the Shearer memos in Aug. 2016 — though not by Shearer — told TheDCNF that the allegations were not taken seriously because Shearer was “not a guy with a whole lot of credibility.”
“The whole thing stinks,” recalled the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the Russia investigation.
The official said that Shearer’s effort showed that Clinton loyalists were “doing their best to get this stuff out into the mainstream media before the election.”
Shearer’s memos have received little media attention since their existence was revealed in January. The Guardian broke the story that the documents had been passed to the FBI through Steele and that the bureau was attempting to ascertain their accuracy. Steele reportedly told the FBI that the information came ultimately from Shearer.
Shearer first gained notoriety in 1991 when he was involved in spreading the false claim that then-Vice President Dan Quayle purchased drugs from Brett Kimberlin, a drug dealer who was the culprit behind the Speedway bombings. It turned out that Kimberlin made up the story about Quayle. He is now a left-wing political activist.
Shearer, whose brother-in-law is Brookings Institutions President Strobe Talbott, was also reportedly investigated by the State Department’s inspector general in the late 1990s for allegedly misrepresenting himself as State Department official during negotiations with associates of a Bosnian warlord. Shearer was reportedly paid at least $25,000 in exchange for helping the warlord.
New details of Shearer’s memos emerged on Thursday with a report from Real Clear Investigations.
Journalist Lee Smith reported that Shearer created two four-page reports entitled “Donald Trump — Background Notes — The Compromised Candidate” and “FSB Interview,” a reference to the Russian spy agency.
Shearer wrote that he relied on information from an unnamed Turkish businessman who claimed to have “excellent contacts within the FSB.” The businessman said the FSB source knew of a “cut out” between the Trump campaign and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Trump campaign was “also involved hacking his opponents and trying to alter votes on election day,” Shearer’s source claimed.
Shearer wrote that his FSB source said that the spy agency knew of Trump’s predilection for women and used it against him.
“From observing Trump for years in previous visits to Moscow, the FSB knew he had a weakness for women,” reads the Shearer memo, according to Real Clear Investigations.
Trump was also aware that the Kremlin had compromising material on him.
Copies of the video were in Bulgaria, Israel and in vaults in Moscow, Shearer’s source said.
Shearer’s memos wove a twisted path to the FBI, with Blumenthal being the initial conduit.
In summer 2016, Blumenthal shared Shearer’s documents with a friend, a State Department official named Jonathan Winer. At the time, he was serving as special envoy to Libya, provided the Shearer reports to Steele, who he had known since 2009.
Steele gave the Shearer reports to the FBI. The London-based Steele first contacted the bureau in July 2016 to share his information on Trump. He continued meeting with investigators through that October.
Steele provided information from his own dossier to Winer. Winer wrote a two-page memo summarizing Steele’s allegations and passed them up the chain of command at the State Department. Sec. of State John Kerry ultimately decided that the dossier information should be shared with the FBI.
According to Lee Smith, the Real Clear Investigations reporter, Shearer’s memos also detail conversations he had with two journalists who heard rumors about Trump’s activities in Moscow. Both of the journalists, ABC News’ Brian Ross and The Wall Street Journal’s Alan Cullison, had been in contact with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele.
According to Shearer, Ross said that he would report on the story if he would “fly to Moscow to tape and air for broadcast,” which he would do if he could find a “talking head source” to back up Shearer’s claims. While Ross did not secure the explosive interview he sought, he did interview Sergei Millian, a Belarus-born businessman who is alleged to be “Source D,” the dossier’s main source for the Moscow hotel room allegation.
The recent book “Russian Roulette” suggests that Ross learned about Millian from Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson. Simpson hired Steele in June 2016 to investigate Trump’s activities in Russia.
“For Simpson, Millian was now an investigative target. He tipped off ABC News, which conducted an on-air interview with Millian, in which he said Trump ‘likes Russia, because he likes beautiful ladies — talking to them, of course,’” write Michael Isikoff and David Corn, the authors of “Russian Roulette.” Corn is the Washington bureau chief of the left-wing Mother Jones magazine.
Millian’s alleged involvement as a source for the dossier has raised questions about the veracity of the document. Former business associates of Millian have claimed that he has embellished his business achievements and connections. According to “Russian Roulette,” Fusion GPS’s Simpson was concerned that Millian was a source for Steele.
“Simpson had his doubts. He considered Millian a big talker,” the book reads.
Cullison, a former Moscow correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, was one of the three reporters who broke the Jan. 11, 2017 story revealing that Steele was the author of the dossier. According to Real Clear Investigations, Shearer claimed in his memo that Cullison told him that the DNC was paying Fusion GPS to corroborate the story about Trump’s Moscow visit.
The Wall Street Journal has denied that Cullison knew who hired Fusion GPS. But as Lee Smith notes in his report at Real Clear Investigations, even if Cullison did not know that the DNC had hired Fusion GPS, Shearer clearly had that information.
It remains unclear how Shearer knew that the DNC was involved with Fusion GPS and how he happened to speak with two reporters who were in contact with the opposition research firm.
Shearer’s memos show he also spoke to Robert Baer, a former CIA operative who currently works for CNN. Shearer said that Baer claimed that “the Russians had established an encrypted communication system” between the Trump campaign and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Baer told Real Clear Investigations that he picked up that story “from acquaintances at The New York Times who were trying to run the story down.” He recalled speaking with Shearer in March or April 2016. As Smith notes, if that timeline is accurate, Shearer was investigating the salacious Trump claims at around the time that Fusion GPS was hired by the Clinton campaign and DNC.",hillary

A Port Authority ethics chairwoman and a former financial adviser to Hillary Clinton was forced to resign after a profanity-filled confrontation with police at a traffic stop.
Police released video Tuesday showing Caren Turner, a commissioner with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and chairwoman of its ethics committee, berating officers and attempting to use her position to intimidate them, Politico reported.
A spokesman for the Port Authority called Turner’s behavior “indefensible,” as the video showed her at one point telling an officer, “You may shut the f— up!”
Turner once served on finance committees for Hillary Clinton, New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine. She was appointed by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to the Port Authority, which controls the area’s crossover bridges and tunnels, major airports and the World Trade Center site.
New Jersey police had pulled over a vehicle with tinted front windows and an “unclear” rear license plate on March 31, according to a police report, Politico reported. Turner’s daughter was one of the passengers and called her mother when N.J. police officer Matthew Savitsky informed the driver that the car would have to be impounded because he didn’t have a current insurance card and the car’s registration had expired.
Turner arrived and can be heard in the video introducing herself as “the commissioner of the Port Authority.”
“She immediately walked up to PO Casper and I and began attempting to hand me a business card identifying herself as ‘the commissioner of the Port Authority,’” Savitsky wrote in the report. “She also exhibited a full-size gold badge in a badge wallet that had the same printed on it. She then began a line of questioning in a demanding nature.”
“You’re just here as a ride, right?” the officer is heard in the video asking.
“No, I’m not. I’m here as a concerned citizen and friend of the mayor,” Turner replied, adding “trust me, I’m very involved.”
She became annoyed when she was informed that the officers were under no obligation to provide her with information since all of the passengers in the car were over 18 years old. The officer directed Turner “to speak with the driver of the vehicle for more information,” based on the way she was “attempting to misappropriately user her professional position to gain authority in this situation,” the report indicated.
She curtly corrected one officer who called her “Miss.”
“No, don’t call me miss, I’m ‘Commissioner,’ thank you” Turner said, repeatedly swearing and accusing an officer of being “an ass” and of having a “smug ass look” on his face.
She unloaded when the officer attempted to end the exchange.
“You may not tell me when to take my child. You may shut the f— up!” she told him.
Turner resigned after the Port Authority was alerted to the incident and the bistate agency’s inspector began to investigate
“The Port Authority has zero tolerance for ethics violations,” Port Authority spokesman Ben Branham said in a statement Monday.

Bill Clinton rape survivor Juanita Broaddrik has just posted a tweet on the 40 year anniversary of her rape by former President Bill Clinton and outlined the timeline of the rape. The tweet is devastating to read and her experience clearly still haunts her to this day.
Juanita Broaddrick has long been a vocal critic of the way former President Bill Clinton treats women. She proved to be a thorn in Hillary Clinton’s side during the scandal-plagued Democratic nominee’s failed 2016 White House bid.Broaddrick has been rather vocal out about her claims that Bill Clinton raped her. She even has a book about it titled, “You’d Better Put Some Ice On That.”
Many Democrats and members of the mainstream media have ignored or ridiculed Broaddrick for decades, but she will not be silenced. This morning, Broaddrick dialed it up a notch by tweeting a timeline of the brutal rape she said happened 40 years ago today.
1. On 4-24-78 around 6pm Norma Rogers, my nursing director and I left Van Buren and drove to Little Rick for a nursing seminar. We checked into the Camelot hotel…
2. On 4-25-78 at approx 8am, I called Bill Clinton’s campaign office. I was given another no. to call. He answered.
3. I told him I had brought the information we had discussed 3 weeks prior when he visited my nursing home on campaign tour. I asked if we could come to his office on our lunch break at noon…
4. Bill Clinton replied he would not be in his office that day….. and said he could come to the Camelot shortly and meet me. He said he would call when he got to the coffee shop….
5. I told Norma the plan. She went on to the seminar to sign us in. I told her I would be there as soon as I left the coffee shop. I waited for The call ……
6. In a short time the phone rang. Bill Clinton said he was at coffee shop but it was very crowded…..and then said…can we have coffee and discuss this in your room?. ..I was nervous …but he was the Attorney General. I agreed and ordered coffee…
7. After the coffee arrived, there was a knock on the door. I opened it and there stood Bill Clinton in “sunglasses”. I ushered him to the table and poured the coffee and began to talk about info I had brought….
8. He motioned for me to come to his side of the table and was pointing out the window…. I walked to where he was to look. He said it was an 1800 jailhouse he wanted to restore when he became governor. …….
9. As he pointed to it, he put his arm around my shoulder and I backed away. He then grabbed me and started kissing me. I was so startled and shocked. I told him NO!!……
10. When I realized he was not taking No for an answer I began to scream…that is when he began to bite my upper lip every time I screamed. ….then he shoved me backwards onto the bed……
11. After 40 years, I am still very emotional and tearing remembering what followed. It was a forcible brutal rape!
12. Afterwards……I was sitting up on the side of the bed crying. He simply straightened himself, and very cold and casually, walked to the door, put on his sunglasses and said to me, motioning to my swollen and bleeding lip
13. When I did not show up for the seminar, Norma became worried and returned to our room looking for me. It was less than an hour after the rape.
14. I was lying on the bed still confused and in a state of shock when she knocked on the door. I had locked it after he left. I opened the door when I saw it was Norma. When she saw me and I saw the look on her face, I began to cry all over again……
15. I told Norma everything. She got ice for my mouth and helped me change my torn clothing. She asked me what I wanted to do. I replied “I just want to go home”. She packed our belongings and drove us back to Van Buren.

According to Federal Election Commission records, the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign laundered $84 million.
Yet the mainstream media took no notice of last week’s federal court filing that exposes an $84 million money-laundering conspiracy the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign executed during the 2016 presidential election in violation of federal campaign-finance law.
That lawsuit, filed last week in a DC district court, summarizes the DNC-Clinton conspiracy and provides detailed evidence from Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings confirming the complaint’s allegations that Democrats undertook an extensive scheme to violate federal campaign limits.
That’s so like Hillary! Gaming the system for her own benefit.
Here’s how it works: there are limits on how much a single person can donate to a specific political campaign. But campaigns and parties get around this limit by creating large fundraising entities rich donors can write big checks to. That money is then dispersed around to various political entities to fund candidates.
In this case, the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and other state-based parties created the Hillary Victory Fund. That’s when the money from wealthy Manhattan liberals, Silicon Valley tech geeks, and Washington power-brokers came pouring in.
Let’s just hope that Jeff Sessions makes good on his promise to investigate Hillary’s campaign. If so, she’s headed straight to prison.",hillary

Hillary Clinton’s blame-tour continued with yet another scapegoat in her growing list of reasons for why she lost the 2016 election.
Nearly two years after her stunning election loss to President Donald Trump, the failed Democratic presidential nominee still won’t accept responsibility for her defeat, adding another explanation to her “What Happened” narrative.
“I felt so bad that people had to hide their support for me,” Clinton said during her appearance at PEN America’s World Voices Festival in New York City on Sunday where she delivered the Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture.

http://usapoliticsnow.com/breaking-nypd-releases-incriminating-clinton-evidence-force-fbi-act/,BREAKING: NYPD Releases Incriminating Clinton Evidence To Force FBI To Act,"New York Police Department detectives and sources working on a production of child pornography charge against Anthony Weiner have turned on the FBI for creating “one roadblock after another” and have started releasing incriminating material into the public domain implicating Hillary Clinton in the underage sex investigation.
The laptop seized from Anthony Weiner contains proof that Hillary Clinton knew he was engaging in a long sexual relationship with a minor but did not intervene to alert any state or federal authorities to protect the 15 year old.
NYPD sources told True Pundit that not blowing the whistle on the serial underage sexter allowed Weiner to keep sexting the youth via cell phone and internet chats for approximately another four more months.
True Pundit reports: While Clinton was busy campaigning to be the first female US president with Weiner’s wife and aide Huma Abedin, he was at home sending the 15-year-old online porn and divulging his rape fantasies to the girl, NYPD sources said. Weiner also apparently talked on the telephone with the girl, based on metadata obtained from the laptop.
Instead of rescuing the minor from a sex-obsessed Weiner, Clinton who was the Democratic presidential candidate at the time, counseled her long time aide Abedin to end her relationship with him because bad publicity could harm the campaign.
NYPD officials said Clinton and Abedin discovered Weiner’s sexting with the minor in April 2016 and that he had already been corresponding with the youth for months.
Neither Clinton nor Abedin apparently did anything to stop the abuse of the minor. Instead, the repeated incidents — which breach a host of state and federal laws — were kept quiet.
Yet Clinton, who champions herself as a women’s rights advocate, did nothing to help the girl.
And it gets even worse. NYPD said the high school sophomore was suffering from depression and told Weiner during over seven months of correspondence that she often wanted to end her life. Weiner did nothing to try to stop the girl from hurting herself, NYPD sources said.
It is not clear whether Abedin or Clinton knew the girl was having suicidal thoughts. But NYPD sources said the FBI did know because the proof is warehoused on Weiner’s silver Dell Inspiron 15 7000 laptop, which the FBI obtained via search warrant in October.
That means, as NYPD sources highlight, the FBI knew Clinton did nothing to try and stop Weiner from repeatedly sexting a minor during the election. And the FBI likewise has apparently done nothing since the election to charge — or even question — Clinton for what appears to be intentionally endangering a minor entangled in a child pornography case.
FBI Director James Comey said his agents combed Weiner’s laptop prior to the election and found no evidence indicating Hillary Clinton had engaged in any criminal conduct. Somehow, Comey and his understudies were able to comb through over approximately 600,000 emails and files on the computer in a mere week. Yet found nothing linking Clinton to the Weiner child pornography case?
That information does not jibe with NYPD investigators.
According to their intelligence, there was discussion of charging Clinton with New York statutes for not alerting law enforcement that a minor was being repeatedly exploited. But such talk was ultimately quashed by federal prosecutors who said this was now an FBI and Justice Department case and no charges like that would originate from New York or from local law enforcement where the girl lived.
“One bullshit road block after another,” a NYPD source said.
It was clear that Clinton was to get a free pass although NYPD said investigators held out some hope she would be charged after the election, especially when she lost. Now five months later, Clinton is talking about running in 2020 instead of defending herself against criminal charges.
“They (feds) sat on it,” The NYPD source said. “Fucking disgraceful.”
Some of the facts that Abedin, Clinton and the FBI apparently intentionally squelched include:
Weiner coaxed video chats in which he asked the girl to undress and touch herself and repeat his name out loud.
The girl told Weiner that she was a sophomore in high school and trying to get a learner’s permit to and learn how to drive.
Weiner knew the girl was suffering from depression and occasional suicidal thoughts yet urged the youth to dress up in ‘school-girl’ outfits and pressed her to engage in rape fantasies.
Weiner repeatedly told the high school student that he wanted to force himself on her when her father was out of town and away from the house.
Weiner forced the girl to write him a letter saying that their online relationship was friendly and at no time did he engage in sexual conversation or innuendo. The youth complied. That letter is on the lap top and in the FBI’s possession, NYPD said. Weiner may have provided a copy to Clinton to cover her in case these allegations exploded during the campaign.
Weiner used his cell phone to correspond with the girl and the texting apps Confide and Kik as well as desktop Facebook and Skype from the girl’s bedroom while her parents were often asleep in the next room.
Likewise alarming, and largely due to Abedin and Clinton’s silence, Weiner continued to sext the teenager for approximately four months after Clinton learned of the illegal relationship.
The girl might have been 14 years old when the sexual relationship commenced in January 2016, per records obtained by NYPD.
Weiner, who employed the alias of “T-Dog” to correspond with the youth on one texting app, texted the minor after meeting her on Twitter in January 2016. The hundreds of correspondences included exchanging explicit pictures, pornography, sexual texts and video chats as well as possible newly disclosed telephone calls.

http://usjournalreview.com/comeyclinton-connection-found-6-million-money-trail-discovered/,"Comey/Clinton Connection Found, $6 Million Money Trail Discovered","Although liberals continue to blame the second investigation for Hillary’s loss, maybe the real reason was to hide the large money trail that connects him to the Clinton foundation.
According to Gateway Pundit:
“Comey served as general counsel at Lockheed Martin until 2010 when he departed with over $6 million to show for it. That same year Lockheed Martin became a member of the Clinton Global Initiative and “won 17 contracts from the U.S. State Department, which was led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,” Big League Politics reports.
Comey just so happened to have joined the board of the British bank HSBC Holdings in 2013, which just so happens to be a Clinton Foundation partner.”
However, one of the most shocking (and important) conflicts of interest of note is this: Comey’s brother, Peter Comey, works for the Washington law firm DLA Piper, and serves as its “Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas.”
So, who is DLA Piper, you ask? Well, DLA Piper happens to be one of the top ten all-time career campaign donors for Hillary Clinton. On top of this, DLA Piper also happens to do the Clinton Foundation’s taxes. And if that isn’t telling enough, DLA Piper also performed the 2015 audit of the Clinton Foundation when the scandal first broke.
What a crook!

But of course, Democrats denied this saying it was merely a coincidence and the conversation was friendly and not politically centered.
We now know that was a complete lie! Not only was the conversation political the very next day Democratic AG Loretta Lynch approved the wiretapping of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
On top of that, it has also been discovered that of the 10,000 FISA court requests that came in front of Loretta Lynch all but two were approved. Basically, Obama’s AG showed obvious favoritism towards the Clintons by not only approving the wiretap but also denying any investigation into the Clinton foundation for illegal activity. Nepotism is alive and well where Loretta Lynch is concerned.
The Gateway Pundit has reported this and the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts has, since 2005, appointed all of the judges to the FISA court. Roberts is one of the most liberal justices on the court and has been a huge supporter of the failing Obamacare which Trump pledged to repeal and replace. While this court is supposed to ensure that everyone has their rights honored, how can that be when it is known that only 2 out of 10,000 applications were turned down for a FISA stamp? Are we to believe that the authorities got it right at a rate of 5,000 to 1? This is not only “rubber stamping,” this is one step away from a simple stamping machine in the court hallway. Is there any reason for a court under such circumstances?
Now Lynch is in hot water because while just signing off on every piece of paper to spy on anyone for any reason, she signed off on wiretapping Trump in the process. We have already established that the F.B.I. is being called into question by the House Judiciary Committee, so now we can see that this was an abuse of authority used to target Trump without reason. The “Russian connection” was already a known lie by the time that Lynch got the paper, and yet she allowed it to move ahead anyway, devoid of merit though it was. This may be the motive behind Lynch calling for more protests in the street. Not only that but as Gateway Pundit also shows, “This also means that she chose not to investigate the Clinton Foundation for illegal activities but rather signed an application to wiretap President Trump”",hillary

http://viralipy.com/male-prostitute-found-murdered-home-clinton-aide/,Male Prostitute Found Murdered At Home Of Clinton Aide,"A youthful male escort has been discovered killed at the West Hollywood home of a conspicuous Hillary Clinton helper.
Gemmel Moore acted as a gay whore to the first class, including his standard customer and real Clinton benefactor, Ed Buck.
Moore was discovered dead in Buck’s home on July 27th, with examiners controlling his passing as “unintentional.” However, Mr. Moore’s loved ones say they presume unfairness.
The LA Coroner’s Office guarantee that Moore kicked the bucket of an unplanned methamphetamine overdose, notwithstanding loved ones depicting him as being “exceptionally hostile to drugs”. His mom, LaTisha Nixon, asserts that Ed Buck executed her child and has utilized his “companions in high places” to help conceal the murder.
Theblackloop.com reports: As revealed by creator Henry (Hank) Scott;
A story on a neighborhood blog about the passing of a young fellow from a medication overdose in the flat of an outstanding West Hollywood occupant has become universal scope in the wake of having been advanced or republished in conservative media, for example, the Drudge Report, Independent Journal Review and TruNews and on the site of the dramatist Daily Mail.
This is what Happened:
LaTisha Nixon, the mother of Gemmel Moore, was stressed over her child’s inclusion with Ed Buck, a well off supporter of Hillary Clinton. Moore was investing a ton of energy with Buck that he regularly ventured out forward and backward to see him. She pondered who this man was that her child was investing such a great amount of energy with that she solicited one from his companions.
“I called one of my child’s companions and resembled, ‘Who the damnation is Edward Buck?’ And my child’s companion resembled, ‘Gracious my God, that is that white person, that rich white government official person … .’ He resembled, ‘Goodness my God.’ When he quieted down, he revealed to me that Ed Buck was one of my child’s customers and that Ed Buck was one of his customers too, Nixon disclosed to WeHo Times.
As indicated by her child’s companion, Buck was into youthful dark men and into a term called “hammering”. Pummeling includes infusing meth into a man. Obviously, Buck professedly was excited by observing other men high.
Nixon reviewed a period where her child had calling her crying one day subsequent to being required with Buck and she was concerned. Gemmel told his mom that Buck supposedly infused him with something yet he didn’t comprehend what it was. Whatever it was, the medication was making Moore be in torment.
“He called me crying. Three minutes on the telephone hollering and I’m similar to, ‘What the heck is going on?’ He stated, ‘This man, he shot me up with something I don’t comprehend what it is.’ And I’m similar to, my child is having a breakdown or scene. Yet, he sent me photos of his arm, his arm was red.”
That specific occurrence didn’t prevent Moore from seeing Buck. As indicated by Nixon, Buck utilized Moore to professedly enroll other gay dark guys to party with them on Santa Monica Boulevard. Buck would supposedly bring pictures with the guys after purportedly infusing them with meth.
On July 27, 2017, Moore was discovered dead in Buck’s home. The LA Coroner’s Office expressed that Moore passed on of an inadvertent methamphetamine overdose, however Moore’s relatives are not persuaded it was a mischance. At the point when cops touched base to Buck’s home, no medications or medication stuff was found at Buck’s living arrangement. Hence, the capable Democratic gathering contributor is not under scrutiny right now. In any case, Nixon trusted that Buck is in charge of her child’s demise and she recorded a video that she presented on You Tube.
The family has set up a GoFundMe record to cover burial service costs for Moore that has raised $3,465 of a $5K objective.",hillary

Anyone who has ever sat on a tarmac knows that identifying another plane is near impossible. Even if you were in possession of the plane’s tail number of the person you were looking for it would be almost impossible to see it unless you were looking right at it.
That raises the question how did Clinton get so close to the A.G.’s plane and who told him its tail number?
So who told Clinton where he could find her? And, why hasn’t the MSM inquired about this?
It seems reasonable to ask whether high-level F.B.I. brass provided this information to the former president.
True Pundit raised the same question about Clintons’ illicit meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on a Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport tarmac in June 2016, as well:
“The question is who in the FBI breached and leaked the classified information to the Clintons? Was it fired former director James Comey? Deputy Director Andew McCabe? Or, FBI General Counsel James Baker who is believed to be under investigation for leaks. McCabe’s wife received almost $700,000 to run for office in Virginia from Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a well-known Clinton family consigliere who is also under FBI investigation. McCabe is currently the target of departmental inquiries for misconduct linked to Hillary Clinton as well.
The troubling revelations the FBI leaked the classified flight plan of Lynch serves as a double blow for the embattled Bureau, especially since an elite unit of the FBI is tasked with the security detail of the Attorney General. Therefore, senior FBI officials are privy to the Attorney General’s travel itinerary at all times. The Attorney General flies on a chartered, unmarked jet. Very few in the Bureau have access to the Attorney General’s classified flight plans, sources confirmed. While the Secret Service was on board Clinton’s chartered jet in June protecting the former president, Lynch’s security detail was elite FBI agents trained in executive protection. The same unit also protects and travels with the FBI director. FBI sources said Clinton’s Secret Service detail knew the exact tail number of Lynch’s private jet, another tell-tale sign of a high-placed breach in the FBI.”
It would be convenient to blame Comey and move on but the corruption of the Bureau in protecting the swamp has been going on since at least Robert Mueller’s tenure and has become so endemic that the agency’s top brass all should be questioned under oath about who in the F.B.I. had a hand in arranging this meeting.",hillary

She plans to take him down and her plan involves some powerful Republicans.
Wikileaks named Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain as Republicans who were paid off by Clinton to ensure that Donald Trump lost the election, or undermine him if he won as reported by Conservative Daily Post. Her evil plot was revealed in an email sent last July from Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta to top aide Huma Abedin.
Podesta detailed how the funds were being redirected from Clinton’s campaign to the Super PACs of Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush.
“JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign.” The email continued, “Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.”
As revealed in other emails, several members of the Republican Party were bought off in order to push the Clinton agenda forward.
Only one day before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trump’s invitation to speak at an event in Wisconsin, an email was sent out that could be to blame. It read, “He is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only.”
Other Clinton emails imply that money is being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For example, right after John McCain attacked President Trump by publicly criticizing him, FEC records show that two large donations from PACS and private sources went to the senator immediately after.

http://www.usanewspolitics.com/2017/07/26/breaking-witness-major-hillary-crime-just-agreed-testify/,BREAKING: Witness to Major Hillary Crime Just Agreed to Testify,"The web of lies Hillary Clinton wove so carefully is finally unraveling. Thanks to the focus President Trump has put on the Clintons’ wrongdoings, the Senate is investigating the criminal relationship between Clinton and the anti-American firm, Fusion GPS.
This is the company that put out the fake Trump dossier. They also have ties to the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Jr. Now, the head of Fusion GPS has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Their crimes will be exposed!
This absurd Russia investigation has gone on long enough. The American people are sick of the side show because we know that Trump has not colluded with the Russian government on anything. However, the investigation into Trump has served to highlight the real criminal acts of the Clintons!
It all comes back to Fusion GPS. The Washington, DC-based “opposition research” firm has been on the Democrat payroll for years. Remember the debunked dossier? It alleged that Trump was surrounded by prostitutes as he urinated on a bed Obama had slept in at a Russian hotel.
That ridiculous story destroyed the credibility of the website BuzzFeed and was the product of Fusion GPS. The project was originally paid for by anti-Trump RINOs and later taken over by the DNC.
Interestingly, the “source” of the dossier was former MI6 agent Christopher Steele–yet Democrats are never accused of “British collusion.” Isn’t it funny how those Leftist double standards work?
Fusion GPS is one of the most corrupt organizations in politics, and one doing the Democrat Party’s bidding. It’s a HUGE step in the right direction for the Senate Judiciary Committee to call their head, Glenn Simpson, to testify.
Simpson originally rejected a Senate request to provide information voluntarily and stated he would invoke the Fifth Amendment at a public hearing. In response, the Senate issued a subpoena obligating him to appear and talk.
Simpson ultimately reached a deal with the Senate to voluntarily speak at a hearing in exchange for having the subpoena withdrawn. The Senate should do their job and squeeze a confession of wrongdoing from him. There’s hope they’ll be tough; the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who has been a major critic of Fusion GPS.
The opposition research firm has come under renewed scrutiny following the much-talked about meeting between Donald Jr. and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton. The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has professional ties to Fusion GPS. As Attorney General, Loretta Lynch used this professional connection to allow Veselnitskaya into the US without a visa.
All signs point to a setup–a plot between Clinton, Veselnitskaya, and Fusion GPS to frame the Trump team. Even back then, they had this Russian collusion narrative in the works to delegitimize Trump.
The charade is over. The tables are turned. We’re getting to the bottom of this detestable plot to hurt our President. Hillary Clinton and her cohorts in Washington are going down. It’s high-time to put her behind bars! Lock her up!
Is Fusion GPS the key to exposing Hillary’s crimes? Please share the story on Facebook and tell us what you think !",hillary
http://www.usanewspolitics.com/2017/09/22/breaking-forensic-psychologist-exposes-horrifying-clinton-revelation/,BREAKING: Forensic Psychologist Exposes Horrifying Clinton Revelation,"Hillary Clinton is one of the most interesting figures in modern American political history. Her public career can be seen as a nearly life-long quest to become president of the United States–only to have her hopes dashed twice by unexpected candidates.
A forensic psychologist contributing to the Daily Caller recently offered a unique perspective on Clinton’s mental state: He claims Clinton is a sociopath who escapes getting caught through her impulsive lying and extensive knowledge of the law.
Armando Simon spent many years in the field as a forensic psychologist. Based on his experience with sociopaths, Simon declares unequivocally that Clinton meets all the criteria of a sociopathic individual.
He writes: “Let me state categorically that she is a true, certifiable, sociopath.” Simon goes on to cite Clinton’s penchant for lying as one of the chief indicators of her alleged mental disturbance, going so far as to call the former presidential candidate a “pathological liar.”
“First, she has proven herself to be a pathological liar: Clinton insisted her server was authorized when it was not, she boasted of being under enemy fire in Iraq, she didn’t think drone strike locations were classified …”
Simon notes that “a compulsive liar will often lie when there is no need to lie, no point to it, like at one point Hillary claimed to have been named after Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to have climbed to the top of Mt. Everest (she was born in 1947 before that famous accomplishment, 1953).”
The forensic psychologist argues that sociopaths are unable to keep themselves from committing crimes–and claims the Clintons have displayed that tendency with “suspicious” behavior on a number of occasions.
Simon cites the notable incident in which the Clintons stole at least $190,000 worth of White House furniture and other items after Bill Clinton’s presidency ended, a story reported by the New York Times. When caught, they returned the belongings.
However, according to the New York Post, Clinton has been accused of taking furniture from the State Department after she stepped down from the role as secretary of state in 2013. Simon claims sociopaths repeat the same crimes over and over again, especially when they manage to avoid punishment for their actions. And he says the Clintons are adept at evading the legal consequences.
The forensic psychologist describes Bill and Hillary Clinton as high IQ individuals. As lawyers, they are both extremely familiar with the law. And they allegedly employ a “wide network” of “extremely loyal minions” who are well-trained in keeping the Clintons’ supposed misdeeds a secret.
Simon writes that the Clintons’ aides are individuals “who have been thoroughly and efficiently trained on how to circumvent and sabotage investigations and interrogations (for example, you cannot be tried for perjury for saying, ‘I can’t remember,’ but you can if you say, ‘I don’t know’).”
Nevertheless, Simon explains that because sociopaths are unable to keep themselves from committing crimes, they are typically caught eventually–and he suggests the law may catch up with the Clintons eventually. Until then, the American people remain intrigued by Hillary Clinton’s ongoing finger-pointing for her 2016 election loss.",hillary
http://www.usanewspolitics.com/2017/07/15/foreign-country-admits-financing-20-hillarys-campaign/,Foreign Country Admits to Financing 20% of Hillary’s Campaign,"The Democrats are shameless. While literally creating crimes against Trump out of thin air, they ignore the corruption and impropriety that their candidate of choice, Hillary Clinton, is guilty of. Can you imagine the hysteria that would be taking place if Trump announced that one in every 5 dollars his campaign took in came from one foreign government?
Entrapped by the ecstasies of a false scandal that has received a fresh supply of false circumstantial ‘evidence,’ the Left is playing with a dangerous game of hypocrisy that WILL consume them in the end.
For the last few days, Donald Trump Jr. has been the target of a rabidly anti-Trump press over his transparent disclosure of emails with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Every synonym for a conspiracy has been used and the empty-headed pundits have turned to exaggerating what has traditionally been common procedure as an unprecedented act of subterfuge.
If it is illegal to speak with anyone from another country then, as Rush Limbaugh said yesterday, then someone better start investigating and arresting the Clintons, who have actually broken the law.
Zero Hedge ran an article in 2016 in which it is shown that “Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman…has provided 20 percent of the total funding to the prospective Democratic candidate’s [Hillary’s] campaign.”
Coming from a deeply misogynist country, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that the Saudi’s saw their $40 to $50 million dollars of influence as garnering a payoff big enough to overlook their support a woman for president, the same gender that is not even allowed to drive a car in the Bedouin nation.
Trump Jr.’s handful of exchanged emails are a symptom of a diplomatic game that all world players participate in, but Hillary’s naked willingness in allowing a foreign player to have such a direct influence on her campaign IS CRIMINAL.
The media’s insistence on focusing on the former in ignorance of the latter is a clear cut case of propaganda and of the Orwellian world they have subjected us to.

http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/hillarys-new-book-now-has-a-rating-of-4-9-out-of-5-stars-after-hundreds-of-1-star-reviews-were-deleted,Hillary’s New Book Now Has A Rating Of 4.9 Out Of 5 Stars (After Hundreds Of 1 Star Reviews Were Deleted),"Hillary Clinton’s new book entitled “What Happened” is the hottest selling book in America at this moment, and thanks to the deletion of approximately 800 one star reviews, the remaining reviews make it sound like it is a masterpiece. As I write this article, “What Happened” currently has an average rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars on Amazon. Of course just like Clinton’s campaign, that rating is completely fraudulent, but if this really is Hillary’s “final chapter” I think that it is somehow appropriate that she goes out this way. The Clintons were frauds from the very beginning, and so a fake rating for a book full of lies about a campaign run by con artists is just par for the course.
Now that nearly all of the negative reviews have been scrubbed, the “reviews” section for “What Happened” contains gems such as these…
#1 An amazing book! Hillary Clinton dives into to the 2016 election, and finally we get to hear her side of the story. I have been a supporter of Hillary’s for years and this really is the most open I have heard her. I am so happy she finally got the opportunity to share her thoughts on the election, and our country as a whole, unmuted by the fear of losing.
#2 I got my copy yesterday and plowed through it in less than 24 hours. This is THE most open and engaging political memoir I’ve ever read. It’s not even a little dry or self-aggrandizing. Clinton spends time analyzing her own mistakes, but takes no prisoners when it comes to the people who also deserve blame for her loss. Clinton-haters will refuse to believe this, but the book – like the Secretary herself – is also warm and funny throughout.
#3 An honest assessment of the reality of the 2016 presidential campaign by the winner of the popular vote. Hillary is honest, smart, practical, and above all, strong. “I wear my composure like a suit of armor.” She is an amazing person who should be in the Oval Office right now. Instead we are living in a nightmare. My wish is that she will never be silent.
It truly is chilling to think that Hillary Clinton almost became the president of the United States, and it is also chilling to think that there are still mindless zombies out there that would gush over Clinton in this manner after everything that has been revealed about her and Bill.
I am sure that Hillary is hoping that this book will do very well, and certainly positive reviews from her “readers” will help to a certain degree.
Unfortunately for Hillary, the professional book critics have not been nearly as kind…
Reviews of What Happened have been mixed, with some suggesting it Clinton uses it as an opportunity to blame others – such as Bernie Sanders and Vladimir Putin – for her failure, rather than herself. In The New York Times, which supported Clinton’s campaign, Jennifer Senior writes that the book is “a score-settling jubilee”.
In her book, Hillary seems to take a lot of time pointing fingers at people other than herself. Rather than taking responsibility for running a terrible campaign, she told NPR host Rachel Martin that she would have been considered a “genius” if she had won…
MARTIN: “Did you underestimate the way that your familiarity with the American public could negatively impact your campaign?”
CLINTON: “Well, I thought it was pretty revolutionary that I was the first woman to have a realistic chance of becoming president. So, I don’t know how any woman, who is not familiar to people, since we have so many hurdles to over come, could have even been in that position that I found myself. If I had won, I would been seen as a genius, my campaign would have been seen as perfect, I understand all of that.”
You can listen to audio of Hillary making these remarks right here.
In her book, Hillary should have been willing to take responsibility for her mistakes. Instead, she has chosen to play the blame game, and her book should be greatly criticized as a result. But instead negative reviews are being removed, and apparently this is not the first time that this sort of thing has happened…
Amazon is rarely moved to delete reviews so publicly, although in November negative comments under a book by anti-Trump broadcaster Megyn Kelly appeared to be removed by the retailer.
Speaking to Fortune, a spokesperson from the company said: “In the case of a memoir, the subject of the book is the author and their views. It’s not our role to decide what a customer would view as helpful or unhelpful in making their decision. We do however have mechanisms in place to ensure that the voices of many do not drown out the voices of a few and we remove customer reviews that violate our community guidelines.”
But I did manage to grab one of the negative reviews before it was removed, and this one definitely made me smile…
Picked this book up at Wal-Mart out of sheer morbid curiosity. Returned it, claiming I bought the wrong book.
It appears to be written with the intent of securing a luxurious retirement. I really don’t think she cared much about the substance of the book itself – but merely finding ways to fill pages with content so as to generate a marketable product. At the end of the day, her name is what is selling the book; not the print on its pages. And even if she only sells 1,000 copies, that’s enough to make writing it worthwhile.
But if you’re looking for some kind of meaning or understanding out of this book, I’m afraid that it simply isn’t there. It’s merely the continuation of her meltdown performance, after being denied all other public platforms to on which to do so. It’s littered with baseless claims and accusations . . . a painfully stupid monologue not unlike that which you would see on an episode of The Bachelor.
The only conclusion that you will come to by the time you reach the ending is, “I’ve been had”.
Hopefully this is the last that we will hear from Hillary Clinton.
But the truth is that there are so many other “professional politicians” that are just like Hillary and Bill, and they will be running for office all over the country in 2018.
So it is imperative that we all get involved and help to elect good men and women that aren’t in it for the money, the power or the fame. Personally, I am running for Congress in Idaho’s first congressional district, and I need your help to defeat the “professional politicians” that I am running against up here.
If we stand by and do nothing, the next generation of Hillarys and Bills will take over and continue to lead America straight down the toilet. And we cannot afford for that to happen, because our nation is living on borrowed time as it is.

http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/what-now-hillary-clinton-wants-to-be-a-pastor,WHAT? Now Hillary Clinton Wants To Be A Pastor?,"How would you feel if you went to church next Sunday and “Pastor Hillary Clinton” got up to deliver the message? According to Clinton’s longtime pastor, Hillary says that she wants wants to start preaching. Considering the fact that she stands in direct opposition to just about everything that the Bible says, it is hard to imagine her doing this with a straight face. Bill and Hillary Clinton have been fueling anger and hatred toward conservative Christians for decades, but now she is suddenly going to turn over a new leaf? If Clinton announced that she had decided to denounce abortion then she would definitely get my attention, but at this point this just seems like another Clinton political stunt.
Earlier today when I came across an article published by the Atlantic entitled “Hillary Wants To Preach”, I was tempted to dismiss it as some of that “fake news” that we have been hearing so much about lately. But it turns out that this story is actually true…
Hillary Clinton wants to preach. That’s what she told Bill Shillady, her longtime pastor, at a recent photo shoot for his new book about the daily devotionals he sent her during the 2016 campaign. Scattered bits of reporting suggest that ministry has always been a secret dream of the two-time presidential candidate: Last fall, the former Newsweek editor Kenneth Woodward revealed that Clinton told him in 1994 that she thought “all the time” about becoming an ordained Methodist minister. She asked him not to write about it, though: “It will make me seem much too pious.” The incident perfectly captures Clinton’s long campaign to modulate—and sometimes obscure—expressions of her faith.
For Clinton, this would be yet another very unusual chapter in a very strange religious journey. She has always claimed to be a “Christian”, but it is also important to remember that in college she did her senior thesis on a radical leftist that dedicated his book to Lucifer…
In 1993, the president of Wellesley College approved a new rule that all senior theses written by a president or first lady of the United States would be kept under lock and key, a move aimed at preventing the public from learning about their new First Lady. After the Clintons left the White House, however, Hillary’s senior thesis was released to the public – a 92 page homage to radical leftist Saul Alinsky, who dedicated his book to Lucifer.
And back in 2015, Clinton delivered a speech in which she insisted that “religious beliefs” that do not conform to her progressive agenda “have to be changed”…
“All the laws we’ve passed don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.”
Hillary Clinton is not interested in the God of the Bible or in living the way that the Bible actually intends for us to live.
Clinton and her husband have been promoting just about every form of evil imaginable for decades, but that won’t matter to many people. If Hillary wants to preach, many on the left will be absolutely thrilled…
“Given her depth of knowledge of the Bible and her experience of caring for people and loving people, she’d make a great pastor,” Shillady told me. No, she probably won’t go to seminary, he said. No, she probably won’t pursue an official lay position in the Methodist church, like deaconess. (I reached out to Clinton’s spokespeople for comment, but didn’t hear back.) “I think it would be more of … her guest preaching at some point,” he said. “We have a long history of lay preachers in the United Methodist Church.”
Since the election, “I think her faith is stronger,” Shillady added. “I haven’t noticed anything different, except that I think she is more relaxed than I’ve ever seen her.” Maybe after all these years of hard-scrabble politics, Clinton is finally becoming a more straightforward version of herself: a woman whose fondest ambition is teaching scripture in church.
I am just glad that she isn’t in the White House. If she had won the 2016 election, things would have gone very badly for extremely outspoken conservatives like me.
As I keep saying, our nation is in the midst of a cultural war. If the left ultimately wins, they plan to do whatever they can to criminalize our way of thinking. And I am not the only one that is warning about this. For example, just consider what Newt Gingrich had to say about this recently…
“Remember: There are a lot of people on the other side, including in the elite news media, who deeply, deeply want President Trump to fail,” he warned, “who deeply want our values to be wiped out by making them, frankly, illegal, and who are deeply committed to changing America in ways that would turn it into a country you and I would have no real knowledge of and no understanding of.”
In an America where the political and cultural divisions seem to be widening, Gingrich pointed out Trump can make a real difference.
“He’s clearly committed to breaking up political correctness,” the former Georgia representative said. “He’s clearly committed to advocating the kind of future that we want for our children and our grandchildren.”
I wrote quite a bit about this cultural war in my brand new book entitled “Living A Life That Really Matters”. It is my most important book yet, and just today I had someone tell me how it had deeply affected them. The truth matters, and many on the left are trying very hard to convince us that right is wrong and that wrong is right.
If Hillary Clinton wants to “preach”, she certainly has the right to do so.
But in the end, her side is not going to win. No matter how hard the left tries to twist and distort the Bible, the plain meaning of the Scriptures is there for everyone to see. The Bible has been changing hearts and minds all over the planet for centuries, and nothing is going to change that.
And Hillary Clinton better be careful, because if she starts reading the Bible too much it might end up changing her heart too…

http://directorblue.blogspot.com/2016/09/ticked-off-judge-to-state-department.html,TICKED-OFF JUDGE TO STATE DEPARTMENT: You schmucks have five days to release Hillary's records,"By Richard Pollock, Daily Caller News Foundation
A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides.
Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials.
The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications.
In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.
Leon has been impatient with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26 and the rest of them by Oct. 10.
Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.”
FBI Director James Comey told reporters in a July 7 news conference he regarded the former secretary of state as a “careless” federal official when she set up a private and unsecured email server in her New York home. Comey did not end up recommending prosecution of the former secretary of state.
National Security Agency officials were aghast to learn early in Clinton’s term that she insisted on using an unsecured personal Blackberry phone within the confines of her State Department office. Unsecured digital devices are banned from the secretary’s office.
State Department officials admitted in a July 29 response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides.
Department officials balked at searching computer hard drives in Clinton’s executive offices or in security offices where security awareness training is arranged for all of the department’s 45,000 employees and foreign service officers.
In an Aug. 31 hearing, Leon told Justice Department Attorney Jason Lee the documents should be released before the November election.
“I’m sure you can appreciate Mr. Lee, there is a certain time sensitivity on this issue,” Leon said. “We’re looking down the barrel of a presidential election from now in two months.”

http://directorblue.blogspot.com/2017/06/good-news-comey-wingman-robert-mueller.html,GOOD NEWS: Comey Wingman Robert Mueller Hiring Obama-Clinton Donors to Investigate Trump,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has been sainted by the establishment, is a longtime and very close friend of Jim Comey’s, the easily “stunned” and “confused” former FBI director. Mueller’s begun hiring members of his investigative team and at least four of them are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton donors.
Mueller is hiring Democrat donors
So far Mueller appointed at least four Democrat donors as prosecutors.
The National Law Journal reported that Mueller has tapped on a part-time basis Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, regarded as one of the best government attorneys in the country. Dreeben also donated in 2008 to the Barack Obama PAC and in 2006 to the Hillary Clinton PAC.
Mueller reportedly hired Andrew Weissmann, head of the fraud section in the DOJ Criminal Division. Weissman led the Enron Task Force from 2002-2005, overseeing the investigations and prosecutions of dozens of individuals including Republican Kenneth Lay.
Weissman donated six times to PACs for Obama’s presidential campaign as well as the DNC in 2006.
Jeannie Rhee, former deputy assistant attorney general, donated to the Democratic National Committee as well as campaign PACs Obama in 2008 and 2011, and Clinton’s campaign in 2015 and 2016.
James Quarles, who worked as an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force and who also works as an attorney at WilmerHale with Rhee, has a long record of donating to Democratic groups starting in 1987 for the PAC Dukakis for President. In 2016, he donated to Clinton’s PAC Hillary for America.
Comey leaked a memo to manipulate the investigation
Former FBI director Jim Comey leaked a memo of a privileged communication with the President to manipulate the administration into appointing a special counsel. He wasn’t interested in investigating leaks because he’s one of the leakers.
That should end the special counsel but it won’t.
Comey was interested in having a special counsel who just happens to be his friend Robert Mueller.
Comey is a very close friend of Robert Mueller’s. For the past 15 years, the two men have been described as “brothers in arms.” Their work together during the controversies over Bush-era terrorist surveillance has been characterized as “deepening a friendship forged in the crucible of the highest levels of the national security apparatus after the 9/11 attacks,” after which the men became “close partners and close allies throughout the years ahead.”
Jeff Sessions was made to recuse himself but Comey’s friend is acceptable?
Mueller was not fair to targeted conservatives
As FBI Director, Mueller is the investigator who was unaware of the IRS targeting of conservative groups.
The Obama IRS targeted conservative organizations and during a June 2013 hearing he refused to answer or was possibly completely unaware of any investigation.
Jordan lit into Mueller. “I’m not asking you about details of the investigation, I’m saying why were people targeted before the investigation started,” Jordan said. “Why were they contacted by the FBI? … I’m asking you basic questions about the investigation, like who’s heading it up. And you can’t tell me that.”
“This is the most important issue in front of the country in the last six weeks, and you don’t know who the lead investigator is?” Jordan asked, sounding shocked.
“At this juncture, no I do not,” Mueller responded.
“Do you know if you’ve talked to any of the victims?” Jordan went on. “Have you talked to any of the groups that were targeted by their government? Have you met with any of the tea party groups since May 14, 2013?”
“I don’t know what the status of the interviews are by the team that’s on it,” Mueller said.
The victims of the targeting had not been interviewed by the IRS.
Mueller can keep the investigation going for years
Under terms of his appointment by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Mueller will have wide powers to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” and—beyond that—“any matters” that arise from the investigation, including perjury and obstruction of justice.
He can keep the fishing expedition going for years and take it anywhere he wants under the authority given him by Rod Rosenstein.
If the Democrats take back the House in 2018, they will be perfectly prepared for impeachment.
Mueller is winning accolades, particularly from the left, but not everyone agrees
Former Senator Bob Graham of Florida, the Democrat who ran the joint Senate-House congressional investigation of pre-9/11 intelligence failures, said in an interview that while he was pleased by the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Russian meddling in 2016 election, he questioned the choice of Mueller.
“I did not have a good relationship with Mueller during the 9/11 investigation,” he said. “I have some concerns that he will in fact be fully independent, based on what I observed 15 years ago.”
Graham has long been critical of what he says are Mueller’s repeated attempts to protect the bureau from embarrassment over its pre-9/11 failures as well as the former FBI director’s failure to hold the government of Saudi Arabia accountable for its possible ties to the hijackers.

http://directorblue.blogspot.com/2017/09/lock-her-up-new-hillary-emails-warrant.html,"LOCK HER UP: New Hillary Emails Warrant a Special Prosecutor, For Starters","New emails unearthed by Judicial Watch confirm that the Clinton Foundation was in fact a pay-to-play influence-peddling operation far more worthy of a special prosecutor than imaginary Russians colluding with the Trump Administration. It is time for President Trump to keep the promise he made in the presidential debate to indict Hillary Clinton for her crimes:
About 20 minutes into the debate, Donald Trump delivered a menacing threat to Hillary Clinton. “If I win,” he warned, “I’m going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there’s never been so many lies, so much deception.” …
“It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Mrs. Clinton observed.
“Because,” Mr. Trump replied “you’d be in jail.”
The emails fully incriminating Hillary are part of of documents obtained by Judicial Watch under a court order forcing the State Department to find the documents it said it couldn’t find, didn’t have or was too understaffed to look for:
Judicial Watch today released 1,617 new pages of documents from the U.S. Department of State revealing numerous additional examples of classified information being transmitted through the unsecure, non-state.gov account of Huma Abedin, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, as well as many instances of Hillary Clinton donors receiving special favors from the State Department.
The documents included 97 email exchanges with Clinton not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 627 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails had been turned over to department.
The emails show intentional mishandling of classified material and coordination between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation which involved the State Department granting favors and access to Clinton Foundation donors. Some of the emails were undoubtedly among the 33,000 Hillary Clinton and her operatives destroyed even though they were under Congressional subpoena.
Former FBI Director James Comey, who exonerated Hillary first and conducted a sham investigation later, concluded, usurping the authority of the attorney general, that Hillary Clinton could not be indicted for her crimes because she lacked “intent,” even though the law imposes no such requirement. These new documents and emails indicate clear intent and purpose and the failure to produce them was part of the cover-up for her crimes. Among the examples cited by Judicial Watch in the documents:
The new documents show that Clinton donors frequently requested and received special favors from the State Department that were connected to the Clinton Foundation.
On July 14, 2009, Gordon Griffin, a XL Keystone lobbyist, sent an email to Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band, asking if Band could get him into a Council on Foreign Relations dinner at which Clinton was speaking. Band forwarded the email to Abedin, saying, “Can u get him in?” Abedin replied: “Yes will get him in.” Band was a top aide to President Bill Clinton and co-founder of Teneo. Griffin was a major donor to
Hillary Clinton’s Senate and presidential campaigns….
On September 11, 2009, Terrence Duffy, chairman of futures brokerage firm CME Group, a donor to the Clinton Foundation, asked Clinton to arrange “government appointments” for him in Singapore and Hong Kong. Clinton, using her HDR22@clintonmail.com address, forwarded the request to Abedin, “fyi.” Abedin responded to Duffy’s email, saying she would “follow up” with Duffy’s secretary, Joyce. Duffy gave $4,600 to Hillary’s 2008 presidential campaign; CME Group paid Hillary $225,000 for a speaking fee and has donated between $5,001 and 10,000 to the Clinton Foundation. …
On May 5, 2010, major Clinton Global Initiative member, Clinton Foundation donor and real estate developer Eddie Trump forwarded to “Dougie” Band a request for assistance from Russian American Foundation Vice President Rina Kirshner to get the Russian American Foundation involved in a State Department program. Band forwarded the request to Abedin, saying, “Can we get this done/mtg set.” As Judicial Watch previously reported, the State Department doled out more than $260,000 to the Russian American Foundation for “public diplomacy.”
Major Clinton donor Bal Das, a New York financier who reportedly raised $300,000 for Hillary’s 2008 presidential campaign, asked Abedin on November 11, 2009 if Hillary Clinton could address the Japan Society at its annual conference in 2010. Clinton did speak to the Japan Society’s annual conference in 2011.
Collusion with the Russians, anyone? How about Hillary Clinton’s collusion with the Russians in the Uranium One deal which gave Russia control of 20 percent of our uranium supply in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation?
Clinton played a pivotal role in the Uranium One deal which ended up giving Russian interests control of 20 percent of our uranium supply in exchange for donations of $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a federal crime. As Clinton Cash author Peter Schweitzer has noted:
Tuesday on Fox Business Network, “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” Breitbart editor at large and the author of “Clinton Cash,” Peter Schweizer said there needs to be a federal investigation into the Russian uranium deal then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved after the Clinton Foundation receiving $145 million from the shareholders of Uranium One….
Discussing the Clinton Foundation receiving $145 million from the shareholders of Uranium One, he continued, “Look there are couple of things that are extremely troubling about the deal we touched on. number one is the amount of money $145 million. We are not talking about a super PAC giving a million dollars to support a candidate. We are not talking about campaign donations. We are talking about $145 million which by the way is 75 percent or more of the annual budget of the Clinton Foundation itself so it’s a huge sum of money. Second of all we are talking about a fundamental issue of national security which is uranium -- it’s not like oil and gas that you can find all sorts of places. They are precious few places you can mine for uranium, in the United States is one of those areas. And number three we are talking about the Russian government. A lot of people don’t realize it now, in parts of the Midwest American soil is owned by Vladimir Putin’s government because this deal went through. And in addition to the $145 million Bill Clinton got half a million dollars, $500,000 for a 20-minute speech from a Russian investment bank tied to the Kremlin, two months before the State Department signed off on this deal. It just stinks to high heaven and I think it requires a major investigation by the federal government.”
As Investor’s Business Daily editorialized, donations to the Clinton Foundation even played a factor in the refusal of Hillary Clinton’s State Department to designate Nigeria’s Boko Haram as a terrorist organization for two years:
Hillary's emails may be only the tip of an iceberg that could include Clinton Foundation donations to shield Boko Haram from being designated a terrorist group and her brother's involvement in a Haitian gold mine….
Last month, the Washington Post reported on another deal involving Rodham that could prove politically embarrassing and damaging for his sister. It seems that he sits on the board of a company that got a coveted gold-mining contract from the government of Haiti after the Clinton Foundation sponsored relief work in Haiti.
In interviews with the Post, both Rodham and the chief executive of Delaware-based VCS Mining said they were introduced at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, which seems more and more to be an unseemly mix of charitable work with the political and business interests of Clinton Foundation donors.
And then there's Hillary's strange dealings regarding the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram, which just recently pledged its allegiance to the ever-expanding Islamic State -- dubbed the ""JV team"" by President Obama, who has yet to make good on his pledge to degrade and destroy them.
Last May, we wondered why for two years on Hillary Clinton's watch the State Department refused to designate a Nigerian Islamist group as a terrorist organization. This group has murdered thousands as it wages a real war on women. As Josh Rogin at the Daily Beast reports, the Clinton State Department ""refused to place Boko Haram on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011"" after the group bombed the United Nations headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria.
Sen. David Vitter, R-La., sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry last week asking for all of Hillary's records relating to Boko Haram and her reluctance to designate it a foreign terrorist organization.
Vitter also requested all of Hillary's communications with Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian construction tycoon who has donated millions to the Clinton Foundation. Vitter noted that Chagoury had a financial interest in the potential impact of designating Boko Haram a terrorist group
How many of the more than 30,000 ""personal"" emails that Hillary deleted from her private account relate to these matters? Is that why she needed a private email server? We need to see that server. It might provide, er, a veritable gold mine of information.
The documents obtained by Judicial Watch constitute an equally valuable gold mine of information. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have a chance to right a great wrong here. Director Comey tried to put the fix in for Hillary by not convening a grand jury, moving to have a special prosecutor appointed, and by not showing up for a cursory interview of Hillary which was not done under oath. The infamous tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch was merely the frosting on this cake.
Comey deserved to be fired for letting Hillary Clinton skate and he isn’t out of the legal woods himself yet. But Hillary’s crimes in fact cry out for a special prosecutor. As Judicial Watch concludes:
“The emails show ‘what happened’ was that Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin obviously violated laws about the handling of classified information and turned the State Department into a pay for play tool for the corrupt Clinton Foundation,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The clear and mounting evidence of pay for play and mishandling of classified information warrant a serious criminal investigation by an independent Trump Justice Department.”
Lock her up -- and while we’re at, how about Huma Abedin and James Comey as well?

http://www.usatwentyfour.com/new-huma-abedin-emails-show-clinton-donors-receiving-special-treatment-clinton-department-state/,New Huma Abedin Emails Show Clinton Donors Receiving Special Treatment From Clinton Department Of State,"Judicial Watch today released 448 pages of documents from the U.S. Department of State revealing new incidents of Huma Abedin, deputy chief of staff to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, providing special State Department treatment to major donors to the Clinton Foundation and political campaigns.
The heavily redacted documents from Abedin’s non-government account include an email from Hillary Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, to Abedin revealing that he acted as a go-between for a Clinton Foundation donor, Richard Park. And they reveal Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band instructing Abedin to “show love” to Clinton donor Andrew Liveris.
The documents included six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department.
The documents are in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) for: “All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non-‘state.gov’ email address.”
A number of emails show the free flow of information and requests for favors between Clinton’s State Department and the Clinton Foundation.
In July 2009, in reference to the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Clinton Global Initiative head Doug Band told Abedin that she “Need[s] to show love” to Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical. Band also asked for Liveris to be introduced to Hillary, “and have her mention both me and wjc”. Dow gave between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Band also pushes for Clinton to do a favor for Karlheinz Koegel, a major Clinton Foundation contributor, who wanted Hillary Clinton to give the “honor speech” for his media prize to “Merkel.”
The emails reveal that on June 19, 2009, Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, passed a long a letter for Hillary Clinton for Clinton donor Richard Park. Park donated $100,000 to Bill Clinton as far back as 1993 and is listed by the Clinton Foundation as a $100,000 to $250,000 donor.
The Washington Examiner reported:
In March 2012, Bill Clinton received an invitation to speak at the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea…. Richard Park’s friendship with Tony Rodham earned him a direct line to Hillary Clinton while she served as secretary of state. In January 2013, the Korean businessman sent Rodham an email and asked him to “forward this to your sister.”
On November 14, 2009, Clinton donor Ben Ringel, who has appeared in numerous prior emails asking for favors, emailed Abedin to get help in getting an Iranian woman a visa to come to the United States. He writes: “We need to get her clearance even only temporary to be with her granddaughter.” Abedin forwarded the request to Lauren Jiloty, asking her “Can U help Monday with consular affairs?” Jiloty replies, “Sure. Will look into it.” Ringel donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation. In May, Band, working through Abedin, attempts to help Canadian concert promoter and Foundation donor Michael Cohl with the processing of a visa. Abedin passes the request to Monica Hanley, Clinton’s “confidential assistant.”
The emails show that the Clinton Foundation operative Band was involved in personnel matters at the Clinton State Department. In a May 2009 email exchange between Band and Abedin, a “career post” to East Timor for someone is discussed. Abedin explains to Band that Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton’s then-chief of staff, was working on the situation “under the radar.”
In August 2009, Band tells Abedin of someone who wants to be the ambassador to Barbados. Abedin replies: “I know, he’s emailed a few times. But she wants to give to someone else.”
The emails also show that Abedin received advice from her mother, Saleha Abedin (a controversial Islamist activist), on whom the Obama administration should appoint as the US Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. She notes that she has obtained a recommendation from “Hassan” (NFI), and that she’d reached out to “Ishanoglu”. This is presumably Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, a Turkish academic and the former Secretary-General of the OIC. Ihsanoglu famously called on the West to enact anti-Islamic blasphemy laws.
On Monday, June 8, Clinton emails her aide Lona Valmoro and Abedin asking to attend a cabinet meeting: “I heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are you sending?” Valmoro answers: “It is actually not a full cabinet meeting today – those agencies that received recovery money were invited to attend/participate. We were welcome to send a representative though, not sure if we have anyone going.”
Other emails found in Abedin’s unsecure email account appear to show additional instances of the Clinton State Department’s lax approach to protecting national security.
On July 4, 2009, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Jonathan “Scott” Gration sent Abedin an email that the State Department has classified in part and redacted because the information deals with “foreign governments” and “national defense or foreign policy.” Abedin forwarded Gration’s email to her personal, unsecure email account. In his email, Gration related his meeting with Libyan president Muammar Qadafi, saying: “I conveyed our appreciation for Libya’s role to improve relations between Chad and Sudan … Leader al-Qadafi promised to continue his nation’s close collaboration with the United States … and is eager to meet you and President Obama.…” Gration would later be fired for, among other things, using personal email accounts to send government information.
A document titled “HRC PRIVATE LINE BLOCK” gives the planned whereabouts for President Obama for Thursday, June 4, 2009: “Attend POTUS Foreign Policy Speech at Cairo University.” In another example of lax concern for security, Valmoro forwarded Clinton’s detailed daily schedule for July 15, 2009, to officers of the Clinton Foundation, including Doug Band and Justin Cooper. Again, on July 26 Valmoro forwarded Hillary’s detailed, sensitive daily schedule to numerous Clinton Foundation officials.
In other examples of lax concern for security, on June 11, there is a reference to testing the “Federal preparedness and response for an international terrorist threat to the United States. [Principal-Level Exercise] will be a scenario-driven discussion for Cabinet Secretaries, agency Directors and Administrators, senior officials in the Executive Office of the President, or their approved representatives.” A document in Abedin’s unsecure email account dated May 2009 is titled “The Secretary’s Phone Call with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang” is marked sensitive but unclassified and fully redacted, as is a document titled “The Secretary’s Phone Call with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.”
“I’m not sure how much more evidence of pay for play, classified information mishandling, and influence peddling from Clinton’s email server one would need to show a serious criminal investigation is required,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.",hillary
http://www.usatwentyfour.com/new-emails-reveal-hillary-didnt-want-fly-plane-michelle-obama/,New Emails Reveal Hillary Didn’t Want To Fly In Same Plane As Michelle Obama,"Newly-released emails are revealing that Hillary Clinton once demanded a second plane rather than share one with former First Lady Michelle Obama.
Free Beacon reported: The email exchange was part of a new batch of emails that government watchdog Judicial Watch obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Clinton and her top aide, Huma Abedin, discussed in a July 2011 exchange Clinton’s plans to attend the funeral of fellow former First Lady Betty Ford in Grand Rapids, Mich.
“Looks like plane won’t be an issue,” Abedin wrote. “Also, looks like Michelle Obama also going.”
“Is it ok [sic] that we and Mrs. O take two separate planes?” Clinton asked.
“I think it’s ok [sic]. But let me see what kind of plane she’s taking,” Abedin responded.
“I would rather have our own of course,” Clinton added.
The new emails surfaced after other messages, ones released during the 2016 presidential campaign, revealed that Clinton and Obama’s husband, former President Barack Obama, had an antagonistic relationship.
“And she HATES that the president (‘that man,’ as the Clintons call him) kicked her ass in 2008,” Democratic megadonor Jeffrey Leeds wrote to former Secretary of State Colin Powell in March 2015. “She can’t believe it or accept it.”
Leeds also addressed the growing controversy over Clinton’s use of a private email server at the State Department, writing that then-President Obama would not care if Clinton found herself in legal trouble.
“I don’t think the president would weep if she found herself in real legal trouble. She’ll pummel his legacy if she gets a chance and he knows it,” Leeds said.
The exchange between Clinton and Abedin came after another message, one also released during the 2016 election, showed that Clinton complained commercial flights were “burdensome” and asked Abedin to get the Air Force to fly her from Westchester, N.Y. back to Washington, D.C.

http://www.usatwentyfour.com/new-hillary-emails-show-classified-information-sent-clinton-foundation-employees/,New Hillary Emails Show Classified Information Sent To Clinton Foundation Employees,"Via Judicial Watch:
The records were obtained in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) after it failed to respond to a March 18, 2015, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking: “All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non-‘state.gov’ email address.”
The new documents included 115 Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 432 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department. These records further appear to contradict statements by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails were turned over to the State Department.
On December 6, 2010, Secretary Clinton shared classified information with non-U.S. government employees Justin Cooper, then-aide to President Clinton who helped manage Hillary Clinton’s unsecure email system, and Clinton Foundation director Doug Band (neither of whom held security clearances). The email instructs her aide Oscar Flores to “print for Bill” (presumably Bill Clinton). The email exchange, which involved allegations of the theft of foreign aid by Bangladeshi banker and major Clinton Foundation donor Muhammad Yunus, started with an email from an unidentified person to State Department official Melanne Verveer, who forwarded her exchange on to Hillary Clinton, who then sent it on to Flores, Cooper and Band.
For example, in a May 2010 email, Huma Abedin says she has “hooked up” people from the Russian American Foundation with “the right people” at the State Department:

The Russia-American Foundation was staffed by Clinton political supporters and operatives, received over $260,000 in grants for “public diplomacy” from the Clinton State Department, and its leadership was supportive of Obama’s Russia policies.
President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton had this to say about the new revelation:
“These shocking new Clinton emails show why the Justice Department should reevaluate, reopen, or reinvigorate Clinton, Inc. investigations. The casual violation of laws concerning classified material and noxious influence peddling show the Clinton State Department was ‘corruption central’ in the Obama administration. No wonder Clinton’s allies in the State and Justice Departments had been slow-walking and hiding these emails.”
This must be the ‘nothing burger’ Hillary Clinton was talking about yesterday in her deranged tirade at the Recode convention. According to Hillary Clinton, sharing classified information to people who do not have the proper clearances is no big deal….and she wonders why she lost the election in an electoral landslide.

http://www.usatwentyfour.com/early-morning-tweets-trump-slams-jeff-sessions-weak-clinton-crimes/,"In Early-Morning Tweets, Trump Slams Jeff Sessions For Being ‘Very Weak’ On Clinton Crimes","The President of the United States dedicated his morning Twitter tirade Tuesday to a two-part assault on Sessions, blasting him for ignoring what he said were Ukrainian efforts to help Hillary Clinton and having a “very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.
Trump also accused acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe of not probing Clinton because she donated money to McCabe’s wife’s political campaign, and alleged that Democrats had help from Ukraine in the 2016 election.
“Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign – ‘quietly working to boost Clinton.’ So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity,” the president tweeted Tuesday morning.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017
Less than 10 minutes later, Trump added: “Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!”
The two tweets came a day after Trump called Sessions “beleaguered” on Twitter.
“After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that “Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia,” the president tweeted on Monday, later adding, “So why aren’t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?”
Though Trump did not elaborate on why Sessions is “beleaguered,” the Monday tweets and now the Tuesday tweets come less than a week after Trump criticized Sessions for recusing himself from the Department of Justice’s Russia investigation into meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
“Sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump told The New York Times in an interview on Wednesday.
The public criticisms have raised speculation that Sessions, who was the first Senator to back Trump, could resign, though the attorney general said last week at a news conference that he intends to remain head of the Justice Department.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the tweets sent Monday and Tuesday.
Sessions was at the White House on Monday, but a Justice Department spokeswoman told the Washington Examiner it was due to a “standing lunch meeting” that occurs “every week.” Sessions and Trump have not yet talked since last week’s New York Times interview.
Trump also zinged the acting FBI director McCabe nine minutes after his two tweets at the attorney general.
“Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife” Trump wrote of McCabe.

McCabe has been in charge of the FBI since early May after former Director James Comey was fired by Trump.
The Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General said in January it was reviewing the FBI’s handling of Hilary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the reason the president dismissed Comey, according to a memorandum by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
In October, it was reported that a political action committee affiliated with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who has ties to Hillary Clinton, donated nearly $500,000 to the losing campaign of McCabe’s wife Jill McCabe during the 2015 Virginia state election.",hillary
http://www.usatwentyfour.com/u-s-postal-service-broke-federal-law-showed-institutional-bias-letting-workers-help-clinton-campaign/,U.S. Postal Service Broke Federal Law And Showed ‘Institutional Bias’ By Letting Workers Help Clinton Campaign,"On Wednesday the Office of Special Council ruled the US Postal Service broke the law when they allowed workers to campaign for Hillary Clinton during work hours on the taxpayer dime.
The Office of Special Counsel determined USPS engaged in a “systemic violation” of the Hatch Act, which places limitations on the political activities of federal employees dating back to the 1990s.
Though federal workers are permitted to do political work while on leave from their agency, the Office of Special Counsel said the Postal Service demonstrated an “institutional bias” toward the candidates endorsed by the union, primarily Democrats.
“Specifically, USPS’s practice of facilitating carrier releases for the union’s political activity resulted in an institutional bias in favor of [National Association of Letter Carriers] endorsed political candidates, which the Hatch Act prohibits,” the Office of Special Counsel found.
The investigation from the Office of Special Counsel began after Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, heard concerns from a constituent, Timm Kopp, about leave practices he experienced related to the 2016 election.
Kopp works as a letter carrier, and was concerned the Postal Service “incurred unnecessary overtime costs” and “improperly coordinated” with the NALC, the union.
According to the report, issued to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Wednesday, 97 members of the NALC requested leave without pay to participate in a program, called Labor 2016, to help elect Clinton and other union-backed candidates.
The Office of Special Counsel reported 82 percent of the work occurred in key battleground states, including Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
Those who assisted with Labor 2016 said they helped canvas, made phone calls for volunteers, and participated in other get-out-the-vote efforts.
Adam Miles, the acting special counsel for the Office of Special Counsel, said the NALC gave a list of letter carriers to participate in the campaign activity to a senior USPS labor relations official.
The official then emailed lists to lower-level USPS management officials nationwide.
According to Miles, who is testifying before the Government Affairs and Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, the lower-level officials interpreted the messages from headquarters as “directives to release the carriers” on leave without pay.
The 97 union members who requested leave from the USPS without pay to participate in Labor 2016 were compensated through the Letter Carrier Political Fund, the union’s political action committee.
“As a federal entity, the USPS must remain politically neutral,” Miles said in his opening statement to the committee.
“In many localities, the Postal Service is a citizen’s primary point of contact with the federal government, reinforcing the need for strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the Hatch Act,” he continued.
USPS Postmaster General Megan Brennan attempted to distance the Postal Service from the union and said “senior postal leadership did not in any way guide union leadership in selecting the candidates for whom NALC employees should campaign.”
“Our postal unions do not speak for the Postal Service, and the Postal Service does not speak for our unions,” Brennan said in prepared testimony before the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. “This especially applies in the political context, but it is inherent in any collective bargaining relationship.”
Brennan also said any Hatch Act violations were unintentional, and committed the Postal Service to changing its practices based upon guidance from the Office of Special Counsel.",hillary

When one Twitter user replied and said the study’s results were obvious, Clinton used the opportunity to bash Republicans, writing that Republicans have been trying to repeal free lunches and block nutritional food requirements.
“Sadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches & breakfasts & against nutritional support for families,” Clinton wrote.
Agreed. Sadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches & breakfasts & against nutritional support for families
— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) June 8, 2017
Though she was obviously trying to bash Republicans, Clinton ended up bashing Michelle Obama. That’s because while her husband was president, Obama worked to completely overhaul the national school lunch program while expanding the free and reduced lunch program.
Indeed, the Obama administration was successful in overhauling the program. However, the changes they implemented were not popular and students across the country for years have taken to social media to post the unappetizing and small lunches they now receive at school all thanks to the changes Obama made.
Many people took to Twitter to note Clinton’s apparent slam of Obama:
Maybe you should talk to Michelle Obama about wasted school lunches before blaming Republicans

Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein Calls for Investigation into Obama, Lynch, & Hillary","Sen. Dianne Feinstein says Congress should look into former FBI Director James Comey’s revelation that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked him to downplay the nature of his investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.
James Comey testified the ex-attorney general Loretta Lynch requested that he call the the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails a “matter.”
Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday, noting that Lynch’s request made him feel “queasy.” Feinstein said she would have had “a queasy feeling, too.”
In an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Feinstein, the committee’s top democrat, said she didn’t know if Lynch was providing cover for the Clinton campaign, but said the request would have given her “a queasy feeling, too.”
“I think we need to know more about that,” the California senator said. “And there’s only one way to know about it, and that’s to have the judiciary committee take a look at that.”
Feinstein was firm, however that an investigation into Lynch’s conduct with the Clinton campaign should be separate from the current Congressional investigation into potential ties between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.
“I don’t think we should mix the two,” Feinstein said. “I don’t know whether it’s obstruction of justice. I don’t intend to draw any conclusions until investigations are finished,”
Comey stated that when he asked Lynch if she was going to authorize him to confirm the existence of the Clinton email investigation, her answer was, “Yes but don’t call it that. Call it a ‘matter’.” When Comey asked why, he said, Lynch wouldn’t give him an explanation. “Just call it a matter,” she said.
Comey said that it made him very uncomfortable as it was NOT the truth.
“I don’t know whether it was intentional or not but it gave the impression that the Attorney General [Lynch] was looking to align the way we talked about our work with the way the political campaign was describing the same activity, which was inaccurate,” Comey added.
When asked by Texas Sen. John Cornyn if it would be fair to say Lynch had a “conflict of interest” in the Clinton email investigation, Comey answered in the affirmative. “That’s fair,” he said.
When Obama and the Clintons lose Diane Feinstein, it is significant. This could be a huge turning point. Feinstein is one of the most powerful leaders the Democrats have and she comes with incredible credibility.
This could very well be the crack in the door that swings it wide open.
The Comey hearings told us more about the Obama Justice Department than it did the Trump administration. Comey testified that Trump did not obstruct justice, but that Lynch did.

https://uspoliticsinfo.com/2017/06/01/breaking-thousands-of-illegals-voted-in-state-hillary-narrowly-won/,BREAKING: Thousands of Illegals Voted In State Hillary Narrowly Won,"During the 2016 election, Donald Trump sounded the alarm about the possibility of illegal immigrants voting. The left-wing news media laughed at him. They may stop laughing soon.
Virginia was always considered a state favorable to Hillary. Thanks to massive immigration to northern counties like Fairfax, the Old Dominion may soon become a Democratic stronghold. However, despite rigged polls, Hillary Clinton only squeaked out a win thanks in large part to 5,500 non-citizen voters, via Allen B. West. So, even though Hillary clearly cheated, Trump still won the election. That must hurt her ego.
Furthermore, a public interest law firm has concluded that of the more than 5,500 non-citizens registered on the Virginia voter roles, some 1,852 voted in the 2016 election, via The Washington Free Beacon.
While, in the grand scheme of things, 1,852 votes is not a major margin.
However, Virginia’s problem with voter fraud points the way to even greater corruption.
After all, given that the state of California issues licenses to illegal immigrants, it stands to reason that they allow illegal aliens to vote as well.
In a state home to 2.4 million illegal immigrants, voter fraud is a major possibility, via FOX News.
Unsurprisingly, states with lax voter registration practices all tended to go for Hillary during the 2016 election. These important states include New York, California, Virginia, Illinois, and Massachusetts. All of these states are also home to millions of illegal aliens.
These trends all point out the very base reason why the Democrats are in favor of undercutting voter ID laws, even despite their popularity among the general American public.
If voters are forced to provide two forms of photo identification before casting their ballots, then a large percentage of the Democrat vote would be barred from voting.
Illegal immigrants do not deserve the right to vote, so banning them would be a good thing.

Former homicide detective Rod Wheeler said he didn’t want to reveal Brazile’s identity, but added that after what he felt was character assassination by Rich family spokesman Brad Bauman, he didn’t see the need to stay quiet.
Bauman has criticized Wheeler more than once for not ruling out the possibility that Rich may have leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks.
Wheeler told Fox News host Sean Hannity that Rich was having problems at his job at the DNC before he was killed.
“And the person that called the father after I called the police to get information, that’s the person that Seth was having problems with at the DNC. So connect the dots, here; it’s starting to all come together,” Wheeler said, pointing a finger at Donna Brazile.
If you’ll recall, Brazile, a former CNN contributor, was caught providing Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with questions that she would be asked at a town hall held by CNN. Brazile denied the allegation, and only after leaked DNC emails proved she did indeed provide the questions did she finally admit it.
These kinds of actions embarrass and taint the entire Democrat Party — or they would, if the party were still capable of experiencing shame.

Rosenstein, President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey yesterday. In his letter to Comet, President Trump stated that he believed FBI Director James Comey was “not able to effectively lead the Bureau.” Deputy Attorney General Rod J.Rosenstein blamed Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case. Attorney General Sessions agreed with Rosenstein saying “a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI.”
In its 109-year history, only one F.B.I. director had been fired — until Tuesday, when President Trump fired James B. Comey. In July 1993, President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions, who had been nominated to the post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Mr. Clinton said his attorney general, Janet Reno, reviewed Mr. Sessions’s leadership and concluded “in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau.”
Mr. Sessions had been cited for ethical lapses, including taking free trips on F.B.I. aircraft and using government money to build a $10,000 fence at his home. Mr. Sessions was asked to resign, and was fired when he refused to do so. “Despite the president’s severe tone, he seemed to regret having to force Mr. Sessions from his post,” The New York Times wrote about his dismissal:
WASHINGTON, July 19— President Clinton today dismissed William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had stubbornly rejected an Administration ultimatum to resign six months after a harsh internal ethics report on his conduct.
Mr. Clinton said he would announce his nominee to replace Mr. Sessions on Tuesday. He was expected to pick Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan; officials said Judge Freeh had impressed Mr. Clinton favorably on Friday at their first meeting.
Mr. Clinton, explaining his reasons for removing Mr. Sessions, effective immediately, said, “We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United States as the F.B.I. It is time that this difficult chapter in the agency’s history is brought to a close.” Defiant to the End
But in a parting news conference at F.B.I. headquarters after Mr. Clinton’s announcement, a defiant Mr. Sessions — his right arm in a sling as a result of a weekend fall — railed at what he called the unfairness of his removal, which comes nearly six years into his 10-year term.
“Because of the scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years, it has been decided by others that I can no longer be as forceful as I need to be in leading the F.B.I. and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation,” he said. “It is because I believe in the principle of an independent F.B.I. that I have refused to voluntarily resign.”

Graham believes that Hillary Clinton and the DOJ were in communication during the investigation of Hillary’s emails and her private server which is no surprise but now he believes that there is email evidence of the communications.

President Trump’s tough criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller signals a renewed effort to challenge his investigators’ credibility over their track record of pro-Democratic political donations and other associations.
There is no shortage of examples to fuel the president’s case.
Of the 15 attorneys currently on staff for Mueller, at least seven have donated to Democratic candidates and campaigns, including Trump’s 2016 rival Hillary Clinton. The rest have not made political donations, according to federal records; and none of the attorneys on Mueller’s roster donated money to Trump.
“This is just a witch hunt—it’s all a hoax,” White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway told “Fox & Friends” last week after Trump criticized Mueller in a New York Times interview. “People should know what folks’ past motivations, and their political motivations are—these weren’t minor donations, these were significant donations by members of that team.”
Conway said the donations are “relevant information for people to have.”
Multiple reports in recent days have detailed a special counsel investigation digging deep into Trump associates’ dealings, prompting a range of public responses from the Trump administration. The president went so far over the weekend as to declare he has “complete power to pardon.” But in the near-term, expect to hear more about the political affiliation of Mueller’s attorneys.
Here’s a snapshot of some of the attorneys on Mueller’s team and their political contributions:
James Quarles
Quarles is a former partner at WilmerHale and former assistant special prosecutor for the Watergate Special Prosecution Force. According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, Quarles had made significant donations to Democratic candidates, including former President Barack Obama and Clinton. Most recently, in October 2016, Quarles donated $2,700 to Clinton’s presidential campaign. Quarles also donated over $7,000 to Obama over the last decade. Quarles did, however, donate $2,500 to former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in 2015.
Jeannie Rhee
Rhee is a former partner at WilmerHale who also served in the Office of Legal Counsel and as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. At WilmerHale, Rhee focused on representing people in government investigations including white-collar criminal probes and criminal and civil fraud matters. Rhee donated a total of $5,400 to Clinton, combining donations from 2015 and 2016. Rhee also donated a combined $4,800 to Obama in 2008 and 2011. Rhee also has contributed smaller amounts of money to the Democratic National Committee and other Democrats running for Congress.
Andrew Weissmann
Weissmann served as general counsel at the FBI and was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Weissmann is a veteran Justice Department prosecutor. He was the deputy, and then leader, of the department’s task force that investigated and prosecuted Enron executives in the energy giant’s collapse. Weissmann donated a combined $2,300 to Obama’s campaign in 2008. In 2006, Weissmann contributed at least $2,000 to the DNC.
Andrew Goldstein
Goldstein is an attorney on detail from the Southern District of New York, where he had worked under U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara—until Bharara was fired along with other U.S. attorneys by Trump.
Goldstein’s old boss has become a prominent Trump critic since his firing and has been particularly outspoken over concerns that Trump may be gearing up to get Mueller fired. In a tweetstorm last week, Bharara openly wondered, “If Mueller is fired, how much obscene & horses-t character assassination will Trump & allies level against this honored military vet?” He added if that happens, “do Trump & allies realize he will forever appear guilty of a crime even if the Special Counsel may not have found one?”
Elizabeth Prelogar
Prelogar is an appellate attorney on detail from the Office of the Solicitor General. Prelogar donated $250 to Clinton in 2016 and $250 to Obama in 2012.
Brandon Van Grack
Van Grack is an attorney on detail from the National Security Division of the DOJ. Van Grack donated $286 to Obama in 2008.
Rush Atkinson
Atkinson is an attorney on detail from the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section of the DOJ. Records show that Atkinson donated $200 to Clinton’s campaign in 2016.
Zainab Ahmad
Ahmad is a U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York. She has worked extensively on counterterrorism cases. Records show that Ahmad has not made any political donations.
Michael Dreeben
Dreeben is an appellate attorney on detail from the Office of the Solicitor General. Records show he has made no political donations. Dreeben has represented the federal government in a range of cases — including on the police use of GPS tracking to monitor potential suspects, and whether former Republican Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell crossed the line in performing favors for a wealthy supporter who provided gifts to McDonnell and his wife.
Adam Jed
Jed is an appellate attorney on detail from the Civil Division of the DOJ. Records show he has made no political donations.
Jed’s notable casework includes arguing in defense of then-secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius in 2014 in the Supreme Court case of Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius. The case challenged the contraceptive insurance requirement under ObamaCare. Jed also argued, before the Supreme Court, to strike down the definition of marriage between a man and a woman in the Defense of Marriage Act in the United States v. Windsor.
Aaron Zebley
Zebley is a former partner at WilmerHale, who previously served with Mueller at the FBI as chief of staff. Zebley served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. Records show he has made no political donations.

Nearly two-dozen Republicans are calling on the Trump Justice Department to appoint a second special counsel to investigate the raft of 2016 campaign controversies involving Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration, warning these questions cannot “be allowed to die on the vine” amid the Russia probe firestorm.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and GOP committee colleagues made the request in a letter Thursday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
“The American public has a right to know the facts – all of them – surrounding the election and its aftermath,” they wrote. “We urge you to appoint a second special counsel to ensure these troubling, unanswered questions are not relegated to the dustbin of history.”
‘I don’t think that the crimes of the prior administration, of Hillary Clinton, the collusion with James Comey and Loretta Lynch should be forgotten just because Hillary Clinton lost the election’
– Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to ‘Fox & Friends’
The lawmakers want an entirely separate special counsel probe from the one Robert Mueller is leading into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates. The crux of their argument is that numerous unanswered questions remain from the 2016 campaign cycle that have been pushed aside amid the intense Russia focus.
They delivered an extensive, 14-point request for what a second special counsel should cover, including:
Allegations that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch instructed then-FBI Director James Comey to downplay the nature of the Clinton email probe
The FBI and DOJ’s decisions in the course of the email probe, including controversial immunity deals with Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and others
The State Department’s involvement in deciding which Clinton emails to make public
Disclosures in WikiLeaks-released emails regarding the Clinton Foundation and, according to the letter, “its potentially unlawful international dealings”
Connections between Clinton officials and “foreign entities” including Russia and Ukraine
Revelations in hacked Democratic National Committee emails about “inappropriate” coordination between the DNC and Clinton campaign against Bernie Sanders’ Democratic primary campaign
The “unmasking” of Americans in intelligence documents and potentially related leaks of classified information
Comey’s admitted leak of details of his conversations with President Trump
The FBI’s “reliance” on controversial firm Fusion GPS, which was involved in the questionable anti-Trump “dossier”
“Our call for a special counsel is not made lightly,” the lawmakers wrote. “We have no interest in engendering more bad feelings and less confidence in the process or governmental institutions by the American people. Rather, our call is made on their behalf. It is meant to determine whether the criminal prosecution of any individual is warranted based on the solemn obligation to follow the facts wherever they lead and applying the law to those facts.”
The push comes as Sessions comes under tremendous pressure from Trump to revisit 2016 controversies concerning Clinton and Democratic officials. The president has publicly pilloried the attorney general over his decision in March to recuse himself from the Russia probe, which led to the appointment of Mueller whom Trump has also criticized.
Democrats have blasted the periodic GOP efforts to bring back these 2016 controversies, and maintain that Russia’s interference in the campaign is a more pressing matter. Following Trump’s criticism last week of both Sessions and Mueller, top House Intelligence Committee Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, defended the importance of the current special counsel investigation.
“There is no doubt that Mueller has the authority to investigate anything that arises from his investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, including financial links, and this is spelled out in the order from the Deputy Attorney General and the law that governs the powers of the Special Counsel,” he said in a statement, while also urging Trump to “rule out categorically” the prospect of using pardons to undermine that probe.
But aside from Republican frustration over the evolving and intensifying Russia probe, recent developments have fueled their interest in revisiting 2016’s other controversies. Comey’s Capitol Hill testimony in June included a startling allegation that Lynch told him to refer to the Clinton email investigation as a “matter,” which Comey said made him “queasy.”
The Fusion GPS firm also came under renewed criticism this week when a Senate hearing witness alleged the same firm was connected to Russia-backed efforts to fight U.S. sanctions on the country.
House Judiciary Republicans voted earlier this week to call an investigation into Comey’s handling of the Clinton email probe.
One of those lawmakers, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told “Fox & Friends” on Friday that there seems to be a “double standard in justice.”
“I don’t think that the crimes of the prior administration, of Hillary Clinton, the collusion with James Comey and Loretta Lynch should be forgotten just because Hillary Clinton lost the election,” he said.",hillary
http://federalistpress.com/trump-blasts-comey-obama-doj-explosive-hillary-russia-uranium-report.php,"Trump Blasts Comey, Obama DOJ: Explosive Hillary-Russia Uranium Report","President Trump declared on Twitter Wednesday that James Comey “totally protected Hillary Clinton,” after the FBI confirmed the former bureau boss drafted a statement on the private email case two months before it was over.
In a series of tweets, Trump also swiped at the Justice Department, seeming to suggest they review what he called an apparent “fix.”
“Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete,” Trump tweeted. “Many people not interviewed, including Hillary Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this –obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?”
He followed up: “As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!”
The flurry of tweets was in reference to the FBI releasing documents this week that prove Comey began drafting a statement regarding the Clinton email investigation months before he interviewed her and other key witnesses. The document release was titled “Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01.”
The release bolstered critics’ claims that Comey was drafting an “exoneration statement” well before ending the case and recommending against criminal charges.
The contents of the newly released emails, however, were largely unclear as the majority of the document was redacted. The records, that are now public, show the email titled “Midyear Exam—UNCLASSIFIED” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016 to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, General Counsel James Baker and James Rybicki, chief of staff and senior counselor.
Trump’s Wednesday challenge to the Justice Department regarding the matter was a throwback to his summer criticism of the nation’s top law enforcement official, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While Trump had been at odds with one of his earliest supporters over the decision to recuse in the Russia probe, Trump in recent weeks has dialed down that criticism.
The existence of the Comey documents was first brought to light by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., after they reviewed transcripts with top Comey aides who alluded to the email’s existence.
The Judiciary Committee penned a letter on Aug. 30 to newly appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray noting their findings, saying that “it appears that in April or early May of 2016, Mr. Comey had already decided he would issue a statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. That was long before FBI agents finished their work.”
“The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts,” the letter stated.
The existence of these documents raised questions over Comey’s June 2017 Senate testimony regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation.

http://federalistpress.com/flashback-bill-clinton-justified-sen-byrds-kkk-membership.php,FLASHBACK: Bill Clinton Justified Sen Byrd’s KKK Membership,"Now that Hillary Clinton has taken it on herself to attack Donald Trump for his toleration of white supremacists, it might behoove her to attack her own husband, who rationalized the late Sen. Robert Byrd’s (D-W.V.) membership in the Ku Klux Klan by lamely allowing Byrd was simply trying to get elected.
Clinton was speaking at Byrd’s funeral in Charleston when he slammed newspapers for focusing on Byrd’s history with the KKK. He said:
They mention that he once had a fleeting association with the Ku Klux Klan, and what does that mean? I’ll tell you what it means. He was a country boy from the hills and hollows of West Virginia. He was trying to get elected. And maybe he did something he shouldn’t have done, and he spent the rest of his life making it up. And that’s what a good person does. There are no perfect people. There certainly are no perfect politicians.
Byrd’s history with the KKK and racial prejudice was hardly “fleeting.” He started in 1942 by recruiting 150 people to a new chapter of the KKK in Sophia, West Virginia. He wrote later that a Klan official told him, “You have a talent for leadership, Bob … The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation.” Byrd continued, “Suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone
important had recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought of a political career had never really hit me. But strike me that night, it did.” Byrd was later unanimously elected the top officer in the local Klan unit.
In December 1944, Byrd wrote to Senator Theodore G. Bilbo, “I shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side … Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.”
In 1946, Byrd wrote a letter to a Grand Wizard of the KKK, stating, “The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia and in every state in the nation.” He later protested in 1952 when he was running for Congress, “After about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization. During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan.”
“He was a country boy from the hills and hollows of West Virginia. He was trying to get elected.”
Byrd explained decades later that he joined the KKK because he “was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision — a jejune and immature outlook — seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions,” acknowledging in 2005, “I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times … and I don’t mind apologizing over and over again. I can’t erase what happened.”",hillary
http://www.usasupreme.com/confirmed-canadian-government-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-donating-taxpayer-money-clinton-foundation/,Confirmed! Canadian Government Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Is Donating Taxpayer Money To The Clinton Foundation?,"Oh, so it’s ok for Canadian politicians to get involved in our elections as a lobbyist?
It looks like the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is using Canada Taxpayers Money like it is his own Piggy Bank and just giving away Millions of Dollars, It may be time for Canada to Drain their Swamp.
Between that and his settlement of millions of dollars to a convicted terrorist, Canada must be even more thrilled with their healthcare cuts.
According to the Daily Caller:
A recent Toronto Sun editorial criticized the Canadian government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for donating $20 million Canadian dollars to the Clinton Foundation.
Canadian government filings reveal Canadian tax dollars are indeed financing a foreign health initiative by an organization under the Clinton Foundation.
The editorial voiced concern with the Canadian government’s decision to “hand $20 million over” to the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a charity under the Clinton Foundation umbrella. The editorial went on to describe the nonprofit organization as “the heart of the cash-for-access scandal” that “dogged” Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign.
The Liberal Party government, led by Trudeau, reiterated Canada’s commitment to foreign aid and development in its 2017 budget. A significant component of this global commitment is the budget’s $650 million Canadian dollar (CAD) earmark for foreign aid to specifically “address gaps in sexual and reproductive health and rights in the world’s poorest and most vulnerable communities.”
A spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, department of the Canadian government, confirmed to The Daily Caller News Foundation that CHAI submitted an “Unsolicited proposal” for public Canadian funds. The $20 million CAD grant that CHAI received will be used for a four-year project in Nigeria to “improve access to SRH [sexual and reproductive health] choices for young women and adolescent girls” with public and private partners, as per Global Affairs Canada’s website.
These initiatives fall under Canada’s explicit “feminist international assistance policy,” as stated by the Canadian government. Foreign aid administered by Global Affairs Canada thus seeks to support sex education, family planning, and abortion access across the world.
Both Canadian and international organizations are eligible to receive these funds to advance the government’s goals, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada told TheDCNF.
The sexual and reproductive health project isn’t the first Clinton Foundation-affiliated project that the Canadian government has funded. Canada has previously committed or granted $19.2 million CAD to CHAI for a vaccination project, $14.2 million CAD for a dysentery treatment project, and $460,000 CAD to a tuberculosis research project.
Unsolicited proposals – like the kind CHAI submitted for its most recent $20 million CAD grant – are “assessed using an established process and criteria,” the spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada told TheDCNF. These proposals must include signed agreements relating to procurement, financial recording, and conflict of interest policies as well as an anti-corruption declaration.
The Clinton Foundation has been at the center of a controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton after it was revealed that the charity accepted foreign contributions from Canada as well as from Australia, Germany, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Wall Street Journal reported on this controversy in 2016, revealing that the Foundation accepted nearly $500,000 from a Canadian government agency that was tasked with promoting the Keystone XL pipeline proposal.
Discussions about any controversy and donations to the Clinton Foundation aside, claims that Canadian tax dollars are financing Clinton Foundation initiatives are true.
Wonder what they did for him? Pay for play, that’s how they work. Just think of all the Canadian charities he could have chosen. The election can’t come soon enough. Make Trudeau a drama teacher again.",hillary
http://www.usasupreme.com/hillary-investigator-found-dead-bag-head-along-strange-note/,Hillary Investigator Found DEAD With A Bag Over Head Along With This Strange Note,"Another suicide in the realm of Clinton politics is finally making its way into the light. This time, it’s a Republican operative who was said to be looking for the 30,000 missing emails from Hillary Clinton.
A longtime Republican operative from Chicago’s North Shore (who was at the center of a confusing Wall Street Journal story involving shadowy Russian hackers and Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 missing emails) committed suicide, according to the Chicago Tribune. Peter W. Smith, who was 81-years-old, a former private equity executive and longtime political operative, killed himself in a Minnesota hotel room days after telling his story to a reporter from WSJ, according to the Chicago Tribune.
But there are too many strange circumstances surrounding Smith’s death, and it’s the second one in a matter of months that the mainstream media remains silent about. Smith “killed himself” back in May, but doubts are continuing to surface after Smith was said to have killed himself using a bag with attached helium and left a strange note.
Smith’s death, which occurred on May 14, 10 days before the story was published, was one of the most bizarre developments in a hard-to-follow WSJ story that tried (and in our estimation, failed) to implicate former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in a sinister plot to enlist the help of some Russians to hack the 2016 election…thus ‘proving’ collusion. -Zerohedge
A Wall Street analyst who spoke to Peter Smith the day before he reportedly committed suicide told the Daily Caller News Foundation there were no indications the Chicago businessman and anti-Clinton political investigator was about to take his life.
“He may have been a fantastic actor but I certainly didn’t leave that phone call saying, ‘oh shit, the guy’s at the end of his rope,’” Charles Ortel, a Wall Street investment banker and market analyst, told The Daily Caller News Foundation’s (TheDCNF) Investigative Group.“This does not seem like a settled story. It made perfect sense to me he might have died of natural causes, but little chance he would have killed himself,” Ortel said. “We had countless discussions,” Ortel recalled of his relationship with Smith. “He was using his unique decades of experience in politics to offer me advice how to expose the Clinton Foundation.” -Daily Caller
Ortel also expressed concerns about Smith’s alleged suicide note. The suicide note allegedly and incredibly suspiciously stated: “NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER.” Smith also reportedly wrote that he was taking his own life because of a “RECENT BAD TURN IN HEALTH SINCE JANUARY, 2017” and that his timing was related “TO LIFE INSURANCE OF $5 MILLION EXPIRING.” Ortel said that none of the emails he received from Smith were written in all-caps. “I don’t remember a single one in all cap letters,” he said. “To put that in a suicide note as many times as he did and in language that’s not really professional doesn’t sound like him.”
It is also noteworthy that most life insurance policies include suicide provisions preventing payouts if the policy holder takes his own life (depending on the policy), and that didn’t escape Ortel’s observations either. Peter Smith wrote two blog posts dated the day before he was found dead on May 14. 2017. One challenged U.S. intelligence agency findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. Another post predicted: “As attention turns to international affairs, as it will shortly, the Russian interference story will die of its own weight.”
This “suicide” is being ignored by most of the mainstream media, much like that of others who happen to wrongly cross paths with the Clintons. The bizarre circumstances and methodology of this suicide and construction of the note should be enough to warrant several red flags, but the media is again, for the most part, absolutely silent.

They are the enemy of Trump and his family. If there was something bad about them no matter true or false, the mainstream media would be all over it.
The media has been insulting President Trump and those around him for over a year, calling him a joke, that he’d never be elected, blah blah blah. They continuously LIE so they get what they deserve. Period. They made their beds now they can lay in them! Karma’s a bitch!
Thank God Donald Trump is willing and able to take down the lying mainstream media trying to destroy our country.
Today he proved again what the fake MSM media are doing is wrong and exposed Hillary Clinton!
Donald Trump has launched into one of his trademark Twitter rants, this time defending his son, Don Jr, and attacking Hillary Clinton.
The president sounded more like a protective father on Sunday morning, when he attempted to discredit recent media reports regarding Donald Jr’s meeting with a Russian-linked lawyer during the campaign who promised him dirt on Hillary Clinton.
‘HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?’ Trump tweeted.
He continued in another tweet: ‘With all of its phony unnamed sources & highly slanted & even fraudulent reporting, #Fake News is DISTORTING DEMOCRACY in our country!’
By now we figure it out that the media is the enemy of Trump and his family. If there was something bad about them no matter true or false, the mainstream media would be all over it.

http://www.usasupreme.com/hillary-clintons-broken-promises-came-surface/,REPORT: CLINTON CAMPAIGN LIED! More Of Hillary Clinton’s Broken Promises Came Out On The Surface!!!,"The only thing I can say is that we are so happy Hillary is not in the White House! Don’t get me wrong…I am not opposed to a woman President But, when a woman finally gets to the White House, We want her to be honest, trustworthy, keep her promises and a good leader. All things Hillary is NOT!
Nearly two years ago Hillary Clinton campaign promised to go carbon neutral after the former secretary was caught flying a private jet the same day she gave a speech on the dangers of man-made global warming.
However, she seems to have broken her promise to run a carbon neutral campaign by purchasing credits to offset all the carbon dioxide emitted from her private jet travel. Even though Clinton’s promise to make up for her environmentally-taxing means of travel by buying carbon offsets may have appeased some liberals, it appears she never actually made good on the promise.
Via Daily Caller: “Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign bought carbon offsets from Native Energy, but the company said Clinton did not buy any offsets from them during the 2016 campaign.
“The Clinton 2016 campaign did not purchase offsets from us,” Native Energy spokesman Tom Stoddard told The DCNF.
The Clinton campaign, however, did manage to spend more than $900,000 with the private jet chartering company Executive Fliteways in 2015. About $560,000 of that private jet spending came after Clinton pledged to buy carbon offsets.
Clinton’s campaign spent more than $266,000 with Executive Fliteways in 2016, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
The campaign promised to offset their emissions after The Daily Mail obtained video of Clinton boarding a private jet just hours after announcing her plans to tackle global warming and cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.
Clinton boarded a “Dassault model Falcon 900B” that “burns 347 gallons of fuel per hour,” The Daily Mail reported in July 2015. Conservative America Rising PAC captured video.
America Rising is still keeping track of the days since Clinton made her offset promise. As of Thursday, it’s been more than 724 days since the promise, and no offsets have been bought, according to America Rising’s website.
Carbon offsets are basically credits companies or individuals can buy to theoretically negate the emissions created by their everyday activities. Offsets come from investments in green energy or can come from planting trees.
Many corporations, like Google, and prominent environmental groups buy carbon credits, but critics have argued carbon offset programs can be rife with accountability problems.
It is not what you do …it is what you say and can get people to believe you do. Fortunately, Hillary’s multiple layers of phony, showed enough people to never trust her and kept her out of the White House. At this point, I’m thinking everything that has ever come out of her mouth since birth is a lie. I doubt she’s ever told a single truth.
Hillary Clinton really ought to have stayed in the woods – because it may be the only place she will escape the scandals she has built up over the years.

Once again” why the surprise?” MSNBC lives within their own delusional cocoon, which simply attempts to manipulate facts to comport with their equally delusional audience.
Simply view the brief video, and witness for yourself, how this host attempts to not only change the facts but also slips Hillary into his skewed narrative attempting to include her within the brief montage of actual “elected” presidents.
However it becomes even more bizarre when this guy attempts to include presidents Obama, Bush, Clinton and the elder Bush, who all visited the Western Wall, the holiest site in Jerusalem’s Old City, when they were either about to enter office or out of office, which actually nullifies his overall attempt, in that none of these individuals visited the Western Wall as president.
So why the attempt to change the narrative of a factual occurrence that just took place? The answer, of course, is obvious and perhaps the same reason there was a virtual “blackout” on all three major networks, and on almost all the cable channels, except for Fox’s exclusive “wall-to-wall"" coverage of the president’s historic trip.
Moreover President Trump who just visited the Western Wall on May 22, apparently didn’t rate a photo from MSNBC; however, loser Hillary deserved to be included within the series of presidential photos.
No doubt historians will look back at this moment within our history with a dispassionate and objective perspective of those events that determined the reason for America’s near demise (I’m hopeful we will survive).
WATCH:
MSNBC includes Hillary Clinton in collage of Presidents at Western Wall.
Many Liberals live in parallel universe where Trump lost on Nov 8. pic.twitter.com/taRon4gFJS
They’ll conclude that perhaps the one crucial event within this chaotic period, was when the mainstream media ceased to be the arbiter of “truth” and willfully became the exponent of the left, and an apologist of progressive dogma, and within that role the media subverted “facts” and undermined the will of the people, with an insatiable desire to destroy a duly elected president.
However in so doing historians will also conclude that the press destroyed the very essence of their existence, within a free society.

Clinton says it's important for all of us ""getting to know one another."" And that includes the culture, religion, and food of bloodthirsty jihadists.
This means ""putting yourselves in another's shoes [or sandals], walking in them.""
Getting to knowww you. Getting to know all about you!
Americans should consider themselves lucky they don't have Hillary as their president.
WATCH Hillary making a fool of herself and the rest of us:
As reported in The American Mirror, the former first lady and Bungler of Benghazi said it's ""time to reach out"" to the terrorists with ""steady and determined leadership,"" the kind recently shown by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.
Khan advised the world not to be alarmed after Saturday's fatal Islamic terror attack in London that left seven dead and 48 wounded. It was the third deadly assault in the UK by terrorists this year.
Watch as Hillary calls for a greater understanding of the kinder, gentler side of Islamic jihadism:
Watch:
.@HillaryClinton you don't defeat ISIS with your mindset. One of the reasons they sill exist today. #Trump2016 pic.twitter.com/5CbrajfUc4
Clinton advises that we should show our fellow ISIS head-choppers ""respect"" -- ""empathise"" with our enemies.
So, there it is, straight from the horse's ass -- a recipe for capitulation and further disaster.
Instead of understanding ISIS food, we should be starving them out of every last cubby hole and cranny. Instead of showing them respect and empathy, we should be showing them the gallows and the firing squad.
As Hillary Clinton preaches humanity Islamic terrorists are spreading their inhumanity in every land they infest.
If Clinton wants a better understanding of the food of these murderers and cannibals she should do it on her own time and develop a sudden taste for human hearts.

http://usherald.com/coincidence-hillary-clinton-close-ties-man-charged-threatening-kill-trump-inauguration/,COINCIDENCE? Hillary Clinton Has VERY CLOSE Ties To Man Charged With Threatening To Kill Trump At Inauguration,"Ever since the untimely and mysterious death surrounding Vince Foster in July 1993, (a personal confident and friend of Hillary Clinton), from an apparent “self-inflected” gunshot wound to the mouth, rumors have swirled around for years that the death of the 48-year old attorney found in an isolated park near Washington DC, was somehow directly linked to President Clinton’s Presidency, it was even rumored that Foster’s “suicide” was actually a “murder-for-hire.”
Obviously no one knows the moments leading up to Foster death, however what is known is that during the Clinton’s political rise from Little Rock, to the nation’s capital there has been quite a large body count of suspicious deaths of folks associated with the Clinton's, coincidental…perhaps?
This latest associate of the Clinton's is a Florida resident named Dominic Puopolo, who’s alive and appears quite healthy at the moment, and who has apparently threatened to kill President-elect Trump during the swearing-in ceremony at his Inauguration.
The threat from the 51-year old Floridian came by way of Twitter, however perhaps more unsettling is that this guy is a personal close friend of both Bill and Hillary, which once again has the rumor mill working overtime.
Hillary it appears is especially close to Puopolo's sister Sonia and their mother, also named Sonia, and has donated over $20,000 dollars to the DNC.
Puopolo allegedly posted a video on his Twitter account threatening the life of the President-elect, stating; “This is the 16th of January 2017, I will be at the review/inauguration and I will kill President Trump.”
There’s little doubt that the man is deranged and perhaps dangerous, and thankfully was arrested at a Miami Beach Subway restaurant, when questioned he readily admitted to posting the threat.
Moreover what is perhaps most unsettling is that this guys family is well-known within Democratic political circles for being extremely generous towards progressive issues, and perhaps even more chilling his friendly personal associations with the Democratic leaders

Please tell me this is photoshopped. Please? https://t.co/WezDQx6IvT
No, Chelsea. Lincoln did not attend.
On March 17, the youngest Clinton couldn't believe her eyes -- Lincoln, in a MAGA hat? ""Please tell me this is photoshopped. Please?"" she tweeted.
Yes, Chelsea, Lincoln's press corps were considered highly skilled users of Adobe Photoshop software -- along with the bellows view camera and flash powder.
Surely, Chelsea misspoke. Or did she?
Then again, one would expect a better choice of words coming from a privileged and highly educated liberal snowflake like Chelsea Clinton, who worked as a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014. She's now working for the Clinton Foundation and sits on the board of the Clinton Global Initiative.

http://www.usapoliticstoday.com/clinton-two-names-list-suspicious-deaths/,Clinton ‘Suicides’: You Can Add Two More Names To That List Of Suspicious Deaths,"The Clintons have raised eyebrows for how many people who might have ‘dirt’ on them happen to die untimely deaths.
Cynics just added two more names to that list.
It is possible that they are nothing more than what is claimed: two unfortunate souls who decided to end their lives.
On the other hand, what went with them to their graves will (naturally) fuel a certain amount of speculation, especially among those who think the Clintons capable of great evil.
To the point: Two men were recently found dead. It was called suicide in both instances. Both had (or claimed to have) information potentially damaging to the Clintons. And they have both carried any secrets they may have had to the grave.
The two men in question are Klaus Eberwein and Peter W. Smith.
The former was a Haitian official, scheduled to testify concerning Fraud and Corruption in the Haiti Earthquake relief.
The latter claimed knowledge about the missing Clinton emails, and who was ‘really’ responsible for the Russian hacking — NOT the Russian government.
Both have been found dead.
Klaus was found dead in a Miami hotel.
Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.
Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.
If you’re new to the Clinton-Haiti controversy, this will get you up to speed.
According to Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor, the official cause of death is “gunshot to the head“. Eberwein’s death has been registered as “suicide.”
The Miami Herald also referenced both his death by gunshot in a Hotel and his scheduled testimony next week.
The second death also ruled ‘by suicide’ has provoked wild theories on BOTH sides of the political spectrum.
Peter W. Smith was from Chicago, 81 years old, and a Republican partisan.
He had a history of digging up dirt on political opponents, the Clintons included.
Originally his death was chalked up to old age, or natural causes, including a lead reporter for the case, stating on a podcast that he had no reason to suspect foul play, and that it was likely natural causes.

https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2018/01/09/9292-sealed-indictments-and-the-last-time-hillary-podesta-and-soros-were-on-twitter/,"9,294 sealed indictments and the last time Hillary, Podesta and Soros were on Twitter","An indictment is a formal accusation that a person has committed a crime. A sealed indictment is an indictment that stays non-public until an arrest is made. Sealed indictments are typically used in prosecuting individuals or criminal networks in cases where revealing names could lead individuals to flee or destroy evidence.
In 2006, there were only 1,077 sealed indictments for the entire year, according to a 2009 Federal Judicial Center report. Those sealed indictments made up about 0.96% of all criminal cases that year.
Contrast that to 2017. In less than two months (October 30 to December 22, 2017), 9,294 sealed indictments have been filed in districts across the United States, according to data collected by researchers and gathered from the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) service of the federal judiciary.
According to Marc Ruskin, a former FBI undercover agent and author of The Pretender: My Life Undercover for the FBI, the large number of sealed indictments is something he’d never seen in his 27 years as an agent. Ruskin said this may explain the relatively low profile maintained by Attorney General Jeff Sessions because “If he’s been occupied with an initiative that is sort of under wraps and being conducted covertly, it would explain why he hasn’t had a prominent position in the media as of late—because these are things he can’t talk about.” (The Epoch Times)
When unsealed, all those indictments will require prosecutors. And so it makes sense that on Jan. 3, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed 17 current and former federal prosecutors as interim U.S. attorneys. (Washington Post)
The extraordinarily large number of sealed indictments has sparked speculations and rumors that the Trump Department of Justice is going after Hillary Clinton and pedophiles (pizzagate):
According to a January 4, 2018 report by John Solomon for The Hill, law enforcement officials and a witness said that the Justice Department has launched a new inquiry into whether the Clinton Foundation engaged in any pay-to-play politics or other illegal activities while Hillary Clinton was as secretary of State.
Former FBI agent Ruskin said the lack of chatter about the sealed indictments in legacy news outlets and retired FBI circles may suggest that the higher-ups have no political interest in leaking their content. Ruskin believes that the most plausible cause for the surge of sealed indictment is human trafficking. Even his work investigating the mafia didn’t generate anywhere near as many sealed indictments as those currently pending; but with a human trafficking network, he said, there would be multiple groups operating in multiple districts—which fits the profile.
The rumors are fueled by cryptic “bread crumbs” made by an apparent Trump White House insider who has been posting on the 4chan and 8chan message boards as “Q Anonymous”. Among his tantalizing “bread crumbs” are the following:
(1) On December 11, 2017, Q Anon posted on 8chan: “We have a special place picked out for GS. Really special.” Six days later on December 17, 2017, President Trump tweeted: “Wonderful weekend at Camp David. A very special place. A lot of very important work done.” That led to speculations that George Soros had been captured and confined in Camp David.
That same day, December 17, 2017, Atlanta International Airport had a major power blackout that lasted 11 hours. Q Anon asks: “why did they have to shut the whole airport / time to get one person out / who was the person”.
Flight logs show that, whereas planes were grounded and more than 1,000 flights were canceled, a cargo plane operated by Israeli CAL Cargo Airlines was allowed to fly from the airport. CAL Cargo Airlines boasts a Customs Clearance status — “the ability to load and unload trucks without the presence of a customs agent”. The plane’s records show that it made a stop at its hub in Liege, in Larnaca, Cyprus, and then landed in Tel Aviv, Israel. (The Free Thought Project)
(2) On December 19, 2017, Q Anon posted the message that “We won’t telegraph our moves to the ENEMY. We will however light a FIRE to flush them out.” On January 3, 2018, a fire broke out in a cottage occupied by the Secret Service on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s property in Chappaqua, New York. The Clintons were not home at the time.
One clue for whether some of the key players have been arrested is their Twitter feeds. They can’t tweet if they’re arrested, although there are also other reasons why someone stops tweeting. This is what I found:
7/6/2016: Huma Abedin’s (@HumaAbedin) last tweet. (Note: There is a pic of Abedin taken on Dec. 29, 2017, in which a strange wrinkle on her right pant leg suggests an ankle monitor.)
6/16/2017: Tony Podesta’s (@realTonyPodesta) last tweet. In early November, it was rumored that he’d been indicted and arrested.
9/9/2017: Congresswoman Jackie Speier’s (@JackieSpeier) last tweet. Speier’s other, official Twitter account’s @RepSpeier last tweet, however, was today, 1/9/2018. (Speier has been seen wearing an orthopedic boot.)

12/21/2017: President Trump issues the Global Magnitsky Act executive order “blocking the property of persons involved in serious human rights abuse or corruption”.
12/29/2017: Barack Obama’s (@BarackObama) last tweet.
1/2/2018: Hillary Clinton’s (@HillaryClinton) last tweet. (Hillary was photographed on December 14, 2017, wearing a medical boot.)
1/3/2018: Clinton house fire.
Some observations:
Tony Podesta has not tweeted for nearly 7 months, since last June. But then he hardly ever tweeted.
George Soros has not tweeted for 1½ months, since November 26. But then he is 87 years old. Last October, almost as if he had anticipated Trump’s executive order blocking the property of human rights abusers, Soros craftily transferred the bulk (78% or $18 billion) of his net worth into his Open Society Foundation.
John Podesta has not tweeted for 23 days, since December 17.
Given the recent dates of Hillary’s and McCain’s last tweets, it sure doesn’t look like either has been arrested.

https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2017/10/17/the-real-u-s-russian-conspiracy-russia-gave-multi-million-bribe-to-clinton-foundation-for-2010-uranium-deal/,The real U.S.-Russian conspiracy: Russia gave multi-million $ bribe to Clinton Foundation for 2010 uranium deal,"Yesterday, while on her book tour in the UK, pathological liar Hillary Clinton claimed to have broken her toe while “running down stairs” in heels and fallen backward. (As astute reader MomOfIV points out, it’s quite a feat to break a toe by falling backward.)
I pointed out in my post that Hillary’s story is incredible because:
Hillary’s spokesman initially said she’d sprained her ankle.
In 9 days, Hillary will be 70 years old. Not only are 70-year-olds unlikely to run down stairs, that Hillary did so while wearing heels is even more preposterous given that during last year’s months-long presidential campaign, she was in such bad shape that she had to be propped up while standing, hoisted up a short flight of stairs, and collapsed into a van at the 9/11 memorial in New York.
Using the story of a broken toe, Hillary’s spokesman throws doubt on whether she could continue her book tour, which I predict she will discontinue, if she hasn’t done that already.
Here’s the real reason why the “broke a toe running down stairs wearing heels” cover story was concocted.
The news broke today that the Obama administration’s FBI and DOJ had known, as early as 2009, about a multi-million $ payoff bribe that the Russian government “routed” to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was secretary of state, prior to the State Department’s approval of a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium.
John Solomon and Alison Spann report for The Hill, October 17, 2017, that according to government documents and interviews, federal agents had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian nuclear industry officials, in particular an official named Vadim Mikerin, were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Russia’s atomic energy business inside the United States, including:
Bribes and kickbacks to an American uranium trucking firm in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Millions of dollars “routed” (via money launderers) by Russian nuclear officials to the Clinton Foundation during the time Hillary was secretary of state.
The FBI’s evidence consists of an eyewitness account, and extensive financial records, secret recordings and intercept emails gathered by a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry.
Rather than bring charges in 2010, however, Obama’s Department of Justice (DOJ), under Attorney General Eric Holder, continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, all the while leaving the American public and Congress in the dark, as the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Russia’s commercial nuclear ambitions:
The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the Hillary Clinton’s State Department and Obama government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20% of America’s uranium supply.
The second nuclear deal was made in 2011 when the Obama administration approved Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary’s sale of commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in partnership with the U.S. Enrichment Corp.
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials, “a person who worked on the case” told The Hill:
“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions.”
Congress was kept in the dark.
Former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal:
“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”
In 2015, conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the Russian nuclear deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal — all of which is a lie.
FBI, Department of Energy and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — Moscow director of Rosatom’s Tenex and the main Russian official overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — had been engaged in bribery since 2009.
Despite the FBI’s knowledge of Russian bribery, then-AG Eric Holder, who headed the DOJ (and therefore the FBI, an agency within the DOJ), was on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States together with Hillary Clinton when the committee approved the Uranium One deal.
Neither the spokesman for Holder nor for Hillary returned calls from The Hill seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.
Absurdly, the same figures who were in charge of the FBI investigations of Russian bribery since 2009, are now involved in the investigation of alleged, but still unproven after more than 8 months of investigation, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign:
Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who, as U.S. Attorney, had supervised the FBI investigation into Russian nuclear bribery, now serves as President Trump’s deputy attorney general.
Andrew McCabe was assistant FBI director in 2009 and now deputy FBI director under Trump. Ironically, McCabe himself is under congressional and DOJ inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.
Robert Mueller was FBI director in 2009, and now the special counsel in charge of the Trump investigation.

https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2018/04/16/the-hillary-pedophile-cannibal-video-is-said-to-have-been-leaked-to-dark-web/,Hillary pedophile-cannibal video is said to have been leaked to Dark Web,"The Alternative Media is abuzz with chatter that the long-rumored Hillary Clinton pedophile-cannibal video has been leaked on the Dark Web.
Note: The dark web is that part of the World Wide Web (www) which is encrypted and requires special software, configurations, authorization, or through special networks such as Tor and I2P to access. Identities and locations of darknet users stay anonymous and cannot be tracked due to the layered encryption system, thereby allowing users to talk, blog, and share files confidentially. The darknet is used for illegal activity such as illegal trade, forums, and media exchange for pedophiles and terrorists.
It is said that in 2016, the NYPD found the Hillary video on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Hillary’s top aide, Huma Abedin, who is serving time in prison after being convicted of sexting an underage girl.
The video is said to be so horrible that NYPD officers who had seen it vomited and cried “uncontrollably” and required psychotherapy. We are told that in the video, Hillary and Huma forced a “young” pre-teen/early-teen girl perform oral sex on them, then tortured the girl by slicing the skin of her face off, then put the skin on their own faces to taunt the girl.
All in order to terrify the girl so that her body produced copious adrenochrome, which Hillary and Huma then ingested from the girl’s blood.
It is also claimed that Weiner’s laptop contains “hundreds” of other sex videos, featuring other politicians. Together with the Hillary video, they supposedly are in a file labeled “Insurance”.
That’s what David Zublick claims in the very long, drawn-out, nearly hour-long video below, in which he rambles and repeats himself, again and again. He could have said what he said in 5 to 10 minutes, instead of 50+ minutes.
Disclosure: I can’t stand Zublick and his faux sincerity, and I utterly loath long videos because they often are a complete waste of time — time that I have little to spare. That is why when I do post a video, I try to provide a transcription, to save our readers from spending the time watching the video.
Beginning at the 31:01 mark, Zublick finally got to the purpose of his long video — which is to hawk his series of 12 reports on pizzagate, satanic pedophilia and sex trafficking, which you can purchase for only $25 each or $300 for all 12 reports! Now I know why I’ve instinctively loathed David Zublick.
Note: FOTM has posts on pizzagate, satanic pedophilia and sex trafficking — which you can read for free. Go to our “Conspiracies” page, and click the links colored yellow-green. See also the posts on our “St. Michael’s Prayer against evil” page.
Worse still, Zublick never actually says he’s seen the Hillary video, which means what he claims about the latter is really all hearsay.
Even more disgusting is Zublick saying at the beginning of the video that he would reveal how we can access the Hillary video on the Dark Web. After you’ve slogged through 38 minutes of his video, then he tells you that if you purchase his “bundle” of 12 reports via a “donation” of $125, you’ll get a bonus report in which you’ll find out how to access the Dark Web.
What a slimy creep.
I will never, ever watch another David Zublick video — and I suggest you do likewise.
If the Hillary video was leaked to the Dark Web, you can be sure someone would post the video or at least screenshots from the video on the not-dark regular web. I spent hours today looking at websites and message boards. The only images I’ve seen are alleged “possible” screenshots from the video like this one, which is so dark and blurry, you’d have to be really imaginative to pretend to see something there.
See also “How we know the Hillary Clinton sex tape is obviously fake”.
Update (April 21, 2018)
Jim Stone claims to have seen the video — that it’s real and it is as described:
The Hillary and Huma murdering a child video is real. I saw it, saved it, and the computer it went on will no longer boot….
There are hoax reports out there claiming to be of the video and they portray it as an expensive ball room type scenario where everyone looks ultra sophisticated with the classic old ball room masks. HERE IS WHAT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE.
It is in a shitty dungeon with a ping pong table. Hillary and Huma are dressed like crap. They did not dress up for this. Hillary is wearing silver spandex leggings and an ordinary shirt, Huma is wearing black leggings and an ordinary top, and the video is clear enough to see what is going on but the camera is struggling for light enough so that it can’t get the white balance correct and has noise reduction artefacting smearing fine detail. The video is clear enough to definitely know what is happening, it is a lot better than a “blurry UFO video”, but it is not pretty.
The stupid fake “screen captures” of the video showing victorian style face masks at a nicely lit ball are all hoaxes, the real video is freakishly gruesome dark dungeon “you would never want to be there” type video. Keep in mind with this that there are going to be a pile of hoaxes surrounding this, staged by people who want a coverup. Some are so ridiculous they will make people think “gee, it was all a hoax”, but no, if you did not see Hillary in silver spandex on a ping pong table, you did not see the actual video, and now that I have made this clear, I am waiting for a hoax based on that!.

https://www.vcstar.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/05/26/when-all-else-fails-investigate-hillary/641976002/,"When all else fails, investigate Hillary","Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation has won indictments against President Trump’s former campaign chairman and 16 others and has secured guilty pleas from five people, including Trump’s former national security adviser and two campaign advisers.
This can mean only one thing: It is time to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.
Federal agents raided the properties of Trump’s personal attorney, who was paid by corporations seeking to influence Trump and who was reimbursed by Trump for paying hush money to a porn actress.
As a natural consequence of this, it is imperative to probe the dealings of the Clinton Foundation.
Voluminous evidence has emerged showing that Russians and other foreign nationals met with the Trump campaign with offers to help him win the election.
And this leads inevitably to the conclusion that federal prosecutors must look into the Uranium One sale during Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state.
This, at any rate, is the peculiar view expressed by a group of House conservatives Tuesday as they introduced a 12-page resolution demanding that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate various allegations against Clinton, the vanquished Democratic presidential nominee. They also want this new special prosecutor to look into the circumstances that started the Russia probe, though here, too, they blame Clinton, and to probe the conduct of Mueller and top officials at the Justice Department and FBI, who, as these lawmakers see it, are all hopelessly biased against Trump.
“We need a special prosecutor to investigate the special prosecutor,” asserted Rep.?Louie Gohmert, R-Tex..
Rep. Paul A. Gosar, R-Ariz., joining his fellow conservatives, alleged “an orchestrated campaign against a duly elected government” – namely, Trump’s. “That’s why there’s nothing short of treason for those that actually participated,” he added.
The group of them – 10 men and one woman - tossed in their greatest hits from the Obama years: The “Fast and Furious” gun-running scheme, Anthony Weiner, political targeting at the IRS, Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe’s wife getting Clinton-connected money. It’s a wonder they didn’t bring up Benghazi or Monica Lewinsky.
“It’s the scandal of our time, the scandal perhaps of our lifetime,” judged Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz..
There are just a couple of problems with this reprise of 2016’s “lock her up” mania: Clinton is no longer a candidate or an officeholder. Besides, if the FBI and Justice Department tipped the vote toward anybody in ‘16, it was toward Trump, when FBI Director James B. Comey announced shortly before the election that he had reopened the email investigation. Mueller, the other focus of the conservatives’ ire, is a Republican appointed by another Republican, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who was appointed by Trump.
But such nuance was not on the minds of those demanding a new independent counsel to probe Mueller, Rosenstein, Clinton and, presumably, anybody Trump feels is out to get him – a persecutor prosecutor, if you will.
NBC’s Kasie Hunt offered the conservatives an observation: “I’ve spoken to the more moderate members of your caucus, one of whom used the word ‘crazy’ to describe all of you and this effort.”
Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who wrote the anti-Clinton resolution, argued that “what’s crazy about all of this is the fact that every single thing in that resolution is accurate. That’s crazy.”
No, what’s crazy is that Zeldin believes his allegations are somehow relevant.
Democrats would like nothing more than for Republicans to attack Clinton again; that would further rile the base. This, presumably, is why GOP leaders want nothing to do with the Zeldin resolution. But the conservatives, who tend to come from districts that voted heavily for Trump, don’t care what anybody else thinks.
Thus did Zeldin, reading from his resolution Tuesday morning, sound as if a time warp had taken him back to 2016, or to an alternate reality in which Clinton won.
“With regards to Secretary Clinton, federal law and State Department rules, regulations and protocol were violated with her use of a private email server in her Chappaqua, New York, home,” Zeldin said.
There are 57 whereas clauses in the resolution, and the name “Clinton” appears 33 times, including the Clinton Foundation allegedly getting Uranium One money and Clinton’s campaign backing the Fusion GPS dossier.
Toward the end of this hour-long exercise in subject changing, a reporter’s phone went off. The ringtone was the sound of a duck. It was, quite accidentally, a perfect soundtrack: Having tried all other means of defending Trump, his allies are now practicing quackery.

As the Chicago Tribune reveals, Smith killed himself in a Minnesota hotel room just days after talking to the Wall Street Journal about his efforts, leaving a suicide note that read “NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER” explaining that he was taking his own life because of a “RECENT BAD TURN IN HEALTH SINCE JANUARY, 2017” and timing related “TO LIFE INSURANCE OF $5 MILLION EXPIRING.”
Smith’s death was initially reported by the WSJ to have been by natural causes, but the Chicago Tribune later obtained a state death record that confirmed Smith committed suicide on May 14th and that he “was found with a bag over his head with a source of helium attached”.
Rep. Ted Lieu is doubtful of the explanation, claiming that the note is too emphatic in stressing that the death was a suicide.
“You don’t need to be a prosecutor to know that someone writing NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER in connection with a death seems awfully suspicious,” Lieu tweeted last night.
Senior WSJ writer Shane Harris also tweeted last night that there were no signs Smith was about to commit suicide.
“When I spoke to Peter Smith I had no indication that he was ill or planning to take his own life,” remarked Harris.
One of Smith’s former employees also said that he was getting treated for his heart condition at the Mayo Clinic, which suggests he was hopeful of recovering.
“It’s easy to understand why the death-by-suicide theory is not easily bought. Smith had a long history of exposing damaging information on leading candidates from the opposition. There was a time when he was tasked with digging up dirt on former President Bill Clinton,” reports the International Business Times.
However, the Daily Caller’s Peter Hasson pours cold water on the notion that Smith was murdered, remarking, “There is no public evidence to support that claim.”
Before his death, Smith claimed that he considered former Trump advisor Gen. Michael Flynn to be an ally. Independent of the Trump campaign, the Republican donor assembled a team in an effort to acquire thousands of Hillary’s deleted emails, believing that they related to official business and not private affairs as Clinton claimed.
Smith and his team told the WSJ that they found five teams of hackers, two of them Russian, that they believed had access to the stolen emails. Smith spent his last day in the hotel’s computer center printing documents, according to police reports.
In a blog post written the day before he was found dead, Smith asserted that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election, suggesting that whatever he learned from pursuing HIllary’s missing emails, it didn’t suggest a deliberate attempt by the Russian government to meddle in or “hack” the election.",hillary

Maybe the left shouldn’t have kept shining the spotlight on relationships with Russia, because it turns out that the only actual guilty parties are on the left.
Charges that members of the Clinton campaign were in cahoots with a far left opposition research and propaganda firm, Fusion GPS, it is becoming more and more apparent that many of the false stories that Fusion GPS was pushing came directly from the Kremlin.
Story VIA Michael Ahrens, GOP Communications:
While most in the media continue to focus on a meeting that all parties involved say resulted in no damaging material against Hillary Clinton, there’s little attention being paid to the fact that Hillary’s supporters were able to successfully use a foreign intelligence agent to disseminate false information to the mainstream American press. The phony information allegedly came from inside the Kremlin and sought to damage then-candidate Donald Trump.
Newly-released British court documents show that Fusion GPS, an “oppo firm” funded by Hillary’s supporters, successfully managed to get a former spy to discuss the phony foreign intelligence with The New York Times, The Washington Post, Yahoo News, The New Yorker, Mother Jones and CNN.
From McClatchy:
“Later, Democrats paid for the same research on Trump’s past and alleged Russian ties.
Fusion GPS contracted with Steele, who had once worked as an undercover spy in Moscow. The court document lifted a veil on Washington’s inner workings, with Steele laying out how Fusion briefed select reporters on the material for which it and Steele had been paid to gather.
‘The journalists initially briefed at the end of September 2016 by the Second Defendant (Steele) and Fusion at Fusion’s instruction were from the New York Times, the Washington Post, Yahoo News, the New Yorker and CNN,’ Steele’s lawyers said, adding that he “verbally and in person” briefed the first three organizations in mid-October and a reporter from Mother Jones via Skype.”
On the heels of a CNN report refuting Clinton campaign officials’ claims that the DNC never worked with a foreign government to dig up dirt on Donald Trump, we now know that Democrats actually used a foreign agent to disseminate phony information to the American mainstream media that allegedly came from inside the Kremlin.
And hardly anyone is paying any attention to it.
Background
Fusion GPS is an opposition research firm funded by Hillary Clinton supporters in the summer of 2016. “But congressional sources say it’s actually an opposition-research group for Democrats, and the founders, who are more political activists than journalists, have a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda. ‘These weren’t mercenaries or hired guns,’ a congressional source familiar with the dossier probe said. ‘These guys had a vested personal and ideological interest in smearing Trump and boosting Hillary’s chances of winning the White House.’ Fusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a long-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump. In 2012, Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And in 2015, Democratic ally Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to investigate pro-life activists protesting the abortion group. Moreover, federal records show a key co-founder and partner in the firm was a Hillary Clinton donor and supporter of her presidential campaign.” (Paul Sperry, Sketchy firm behind Trump dossier is stalling investigators,” New York Post, 6/24/17)
Fusion GPS hired foreign intelligence agent Christopher Steele to compile the now-infamous dossier containing unproven allegations against President Trump. “Fusion GPS, which is based in Washington DC and was established by former Wall Street Journal reporters Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, found itself in the spotlight earlier this year after it emerged it was behind an “oppo research” dossier containing unproven and often salacious allegations about Mr Trump. The company had originally been hired by Republican rivals of Mr Trump during the primary campaign. After he secured the party’s nomination, the company was instead paid by Democratic financial supporters of Ms Clinton. In the summer of 2016, GPS hired former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, to help their work.” (Andrew Buncombe, “Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr linked to investigation group behind salacious Steele Dossier,” The Independent, 7/10/17)
Steele “once worked as an undercover spy in Moscow.” “Fusion GPS contracted with Steele, who had once worked as an undercover spy in Moscow.” (Kevin G. Hall, “John McCain faces questions in Trump-Russia dossier case,” McClatchy, 7/11/17)
The dossier contains several anonymous sources from inside the Kremlin. “The dossier quotes from a large number of anonymous sources. It cites ‘a former top level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin’, ‘a senior Russian foreign ministry figure’ and “a senior Russian financial official’.” (Luke Harding, “What we know – and what’s true – about the Trump-Russia dossier,”The Guardian, 1/11/17)
Despite denials from multiple DNC and former Clinton campaign officials, a DNC contractor worked with the Ukrainian government “to dig up dirt on Donald Trump and his top aides.” “Multiple Democratic National Committee officials, former Clinton campaign officials and Democratic sources denied that the Democratic committee or Clinton campaign worked with the government of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Donald Trump and his top aides. But multiple Democratic sources said that a DNC contractor, whose work included organizing political events for Ukranian-Americans, did tell DNC operatives that Ukrainian officials would be willing to deliver damaging information on Trump’s campaign and, most notably, Paul Manafort, his then-campaign head who has previously advised Viktor Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian President who has close ties to Moscow.” (Dan Merica, “DNC denies working with Ukrainian government, but contractor floated anti-Trump material,” CNN, 7/12/17)",hillary

The Democrats’ “Great Freshman Hope,” Sen. Kamala Harris, is heading to the Hamptons to meet with Hillary Clinton’s biggest backers.
The California senator is being fêted in Bridgehampton on Saturday at the home of MWWPR guru Michael Kempner, a staunch Clinton supporter who was one of her national-finance co-chairs and a led fund-raiser for her 2008 bid for the presidency. He was also listed as one of the top “bundlers” for Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, having raised $3 million.
Guests there to greet Harris are expected to include Margo Alexander, a member of Clinton’s inner circle; Dennis Mehiel, a Democratic donor who is the chairman of the Battery Park City Authority, even though he lives between a sprawling Westchester estate and an Upper East Side pad; designer Steven Gambrel and Democratic National Committee member Robert Zimmerman.
Washington lobbyist Liz Robbins is also hosting a separate Hamptons lunch for Harris.
Harris, a 52-year-old former prosecutor and San Francisco district attorney who went on to become California’s attorney general, was a star of the Senate intelligence committee hearing into President Trump’s ties to Russia, grilling US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Harris has also opposed 18 of Trump’s 22 administration nominees.
Plus, in 2013, former President Obama had to apologize after telling a group that, in addition to being “brilliant,” “dedicated” and “tough,” Harris “also happens to be, by far, the best-looking attorney general in the country.”
Despite being less than seven months into her new job as senator, Harris is already said to be the Democrats’ top fund-raiser and is being talked about as a 2020 presidential hopeful.
Harris has denied having “national aspirations,” but this Hamptons trip proves it isn’t far from her mind.
A Democratic insider said, “Kamala is the big Democratic star right now, at a time when they badly need a star. She’s coming to the Hamptons to meet key people as she takes a national stage, and expands her influence and ambitions.”",hillary

Pro-Russia Hacker Site “Cyber Berkut” Publishes Links Between Ukraine and Clinton,"The pro-Russian hacker site “Cyber Berkut” published links between the Ukrainian government and the Hillary Clinton Campaign today.
THIS IS AMAZING—
Cyber Berkut published this damning news today.
Hillary Clinton campaign and the Ukrainian government!
According to Cyber Berkut the Ukrainian foundation transferred 10 to 25 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.
Ukraine sponsored the Clinton Foundation using IMF loans!
The Ukrainian investigation case connected to commercial banks that laundered IMF’s money from the National Bank of Ukraine is still going on. According to the investigation, such banks as Tavrika, Pivdenkom Bank, Avtokraz Bank, CityCommerce Bank, Finrost Bank, Terra Bank, Kyivska Rus Bank, Vernum Bank, Credit Dnepr Bank, Delta Bank were involved in the criminal scheme. Funds were transferred through Austrian Meinl Bank AG.
We, CyberBerkut, decided to contribute to the investigation.
Having examined the materials published on the Internet we focused on two financial organizations named Credit Dnepr Bank and Delta Bank. In comparison with other banks these two financial organizations offshored much more money. These banks are closely related to Victor Pinchuk – one of the richest Ukrainian bankers. He is also a son-in-law of former Ukraine’s President Leonid Kuchma. As it turns out, the offshore organizations that received IMF’s money such as Melfa Group LTD (Belize), Tandice Limited (Cyprus), Tosalan Traiding Limited (Cyprus), Agalusko Investment Limited (Cyprus), Winten Trading LTD (Cyprus), Silisten Trading Limited, Nasterno Commercial Limited, are also connected to this gentleman. Moreover, most of money went to the account of his main money-laundering machine – the Victor Pinchuk Foundation.
So, we decided to track down the stolen funds.
We’ve hacked Thomas Weihe’s email. This man is the Head of the Board of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation. As you can see from his correspondence the oligarch’s foundation is closely cooperating with the Clinton Foundation. And it is worth to mention that Pinchuk and his wife often meet with former American president’s family members. Mr. Weihe regularly communicates with the Clinton Foundation representatives and constantly arranges meetings between the Pinchuks and the Clintons. Here are some Mr Weihe’s emails.
Cyber Berkut then posted this string of leaked emails between Ukrainian officials and

2) Friday night, April 10th at 6:30p.m. Cocktails and Hors D’oeuvre at the Home of Joel Benenson… This is with a broader universe of New York reporters.
The “broader universe of New York reporters” includes several top news anchors for network and cable channels, many of whom are listed as a “yes” for the appearance:
From ABC: Cecilia Vega, David Muir, Diane Sawyer (who could only stay for 30 minutes), and George Stephanopoulos.
From CBS News: Norah O’Donnell.
From CNN: Brianna Keilar, Gloria Borger, John Berman, and Kate Bolduan.
From MSNBC: Alex Wagner and Rachel Maddow (“TRYING”).
From NBC: Savannah Guthrie.
“Yes” respondent George Stephanopoulos worked for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign and was a Senior Adviser to the President during Clinton’s first White House term. Stephanopoulos does not disclose this fact when reporting on the 2016 Clinton campaign for ABC News.
The nascent Clinton campaign invited Jeff Zucker and Phil Griffin, the presidents of CNN and MSNBC, respectively. Zucker declined while Griffin RSVPed “yes.”
Wikileaks’ release of emails from the Democratic National Committee showed then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz scheduled or attempted to schedule private meetings with both executives.Other “yes” RSVPs come from journalists who have been sighted in the Wikileaks Podesta emails, outing them as friendly or fawning towards Hillary’s campaign.
CNBC’s John Harwood, who was also a moderator for a 2015 presidential debate, emailed Podesta frequently, practically begging for approval and access.
Politico’s Glenn Thrush also emailed Podesta periodically. On Monday, a newly-released email revealed a particularly humiliating incident where Thrush sent Podesta a passage from an upcoming article for his personal approval.
“Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,” Thrush wrote. “Please don’t share or tell anyone I did this… Tell me if I fucked up anything.”
Sandra Sobieraj Westfall, Washington Bureau Chief at PEOPLE magazine, boasted two days after this confab that stories on Clinton’s campaign were generating “absolutely off the charts” traffic and asked for “color you can whisper on background” about what Hillary was up to.
The full RSVP list for Benenson’s gathering is shown in an attachment on a separate email:
This is an off-the-record cocktails with the key national reporters, especially (though not exclusively) those that are based in New York. Much of the group includes influential reporters, anchors and editors.
The goals of the dinner include:

(2) Setting expectations for the announcement and launch period
(3) Framing the HRC message and framing the race
(4) Enjoy a Friday night drink before working more
TIME/DATE: As a reminder, this is called for 6:30 p.m. on Friday, April 10th .
There are several attendees – including Diane Sawyer – who will be there promptly at 6:30 p.m. but have to leave by 7 p.m.
…
FOOD: This will include cocktails and passed hours devours.

See: Trump really opened my eyes to the collusion between the media and our government. It’s sickening. So it got me thinking, when did journalism die? Seriously, what happened to journalistic integrity and investigation.
Several top journalists and TV news anchors RSVPed “yes” to attend a private, off-the-record gathering at the New York home of Joel Benenson, the chief campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton, two days before she announced her candidacy in 2015, according to emails Wikileaks has published from John Podesta’s purported accounts.
The guest list for an earlier event at the home of John Podesta was limited to reporters who were expected to cover Clinton on the campaign trail.
The email thread starts with Jesse Ferguson, the campaign’s Deputy National Press Secretary and Senior Spokesman, describing the venues and target audience of each gathering:
We wanted to make sure everyone on this email had the latest information on the two upcoming dinners with reporters. Both are off-the-record.

See: Trump really opened my eyes to the collusion between the media and our government. It’s sickening. So it got me thinking, when did journalism die? Seriously, what happened to journalistic integrity and investigation.
Since Jefferson County District Court Judge O.L. Pete Johnson came out of retirement two years ago to start Veterans Court more than two dozen veterans facing criminal charges, and who have drug or mental problems, have graduated from the program.
The most satisfying part of Veterans Court, Johnson says, “has been all the veterans who have embraced treatment and the help we have been able to get them as they have struggled to get their lives back in order.”
“If it had only worked for one veteran it would have been a success, but it has worked for many … It is working all over the country,” Johnson said.
Johnson, however, said he will be stepping back from presiding over the court after next week’s session because he’s “ready to slow down.”
Jefferson County Circuit Judge Laura Petro will take over as presiding judge for Veterans Court. Johnson and Jefferson County Circuit Judge Stephen Wallace will serve as back up for Petro.

https://urbanintellectuals.com/2017/10/09/why-hillary-clinton-lost/,The Final Word: Here’s Why Hillary Clinton Lost (Sound bites included),"Mme Hillary Clinton won the nationalist popular election by nearly 3,000,000 (2.95M) votes cast in November of 2016, but it meant nothing when it came to the ELECT Elite, who are stationed as point guards to make sure an election is fairly represented by the known census’d populations of each state.
The ELECT Elite (the ‘Electoral College’, as it were) was bound and determined by a combination of what is shoring up to be Russian collusion and -AND- permafrost white-hot hatred of Hillary Clinton, to make sure Hillary Clinton did NOT win that Election.
It matters not how many misogynists just say “yuck” to the idea of a female President, which obviously wasn’t the majority of real-time national voters; but what mattered most is all the junk Black people found out about Hillary when she was running against Barack Obama, which knocked her out of any realm of possibility that she would win in 2012, 2016, or even in 2020.
The “stuff” folks already knew about her and her husband was proof enough that they weren’t going to vote for her under ANY circumstances, even with celebrity endorsements galore. Good thing Maya Angelou wasn’t alive to see that.
In the Democratic scenario, Black voters -who often show up on the Late Freight- are usually the ones who punt the vote ball over the field goal after their white constituency runs the ball almost all the way across the field.
There are a lot of reasons for why that is so commonplace in the Democratic Party, but suffice it to say, Black folks are adjusted enough to the racism in politics that they know they are not the lead quarterbacks of any team or game, including Team Obama.
In this season, they became “reluctant voters” for Trump in the hopes that he was everything he pretended to be. But for those of us who already knew what he was and was incapable of, we’ve been vindicated big time.
As they say, nothing operates in a vacuum in outer space, it has a background. All of it has a history. I have often been accused of “dwelling in the past,” but all I ever do is make sense of the past in order to tell people why what is happening now is happening RIGHT NOW.
So let’s take a real look from the non-elite layman’s point of view about what caused America to end up being led by what appears to be a simple-minded crackhead President who is being enabled to do what he does because the people around him fear to call him what he is. And because he signs the checks.
They can come up with all of the rich man DSM slough-off diagnoses they want to, but just as the Las Vegas mass shooter was no out of the ordinary “lone wolf” assassin, Trump is easier to digest than some professionals have claimed.
“Narcissistic” our red white and blue butts.
He’s a crackhead, plain and simple. Black folks in America have been portrayed as such enough to know one when they see one. Some have said that Rex Tillerson -whatever inauspicious role he’s playing these days before he leaves- referred to Trump as an “f-ing moron,” but no one has been able to prove it.
We don’t have a reason to doubt he said it, however, because that is exactly what Trump has portrayed since taking office: Moronic behaviors.
No President could be less dignified, less credible, and more moronic, especially one that could make George W. Bush actually LOOK smart and well-behaved and pull him out of the trenches of worst president ever smelling like a rose. Not him.
At this point, it no longer matters that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, as an enabler of Trump’s sicko behaviors, is doing her level best to make it look like everything Trump says is planned and done on purpose – no one believes he is that smart – but let us take a look at the reason why she may be covering for what is obviously his lunacy that is about to become her own.
Become? Already became.
Just remember, her legacy RIDES with his and they cannot “drain the swamp” when they brought it to DC with them. They would be rendered homeless without that swamp.
***
But enough of him.
Let’s discuss Hillary Clinton.
Her husband, William, was dubbed the first “Black” president because of his called-black-but-really-white ghettofied behaviors in the 1990s. Mr. “Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.” Memba dat? Riding Music.
The wife, Hillary, had in her history been a Goldwater Girl out of the hardest nastiest meanest racists of the 1950s. Barry Goldwater, as you don’t know, was a hi-falutin’ racist much like Donald Trump is now. He was such a racist that he left the KKK Lynching Democratic Party for the Republican Party just because the Democratic Party, at that time, began to work to make amends to Black America for the sins of its forefathers. [ I speak of the NORTHERN Democrats of the Blueblood John F. Kennedy clan, not the SOUTHERN Democrats of the “Beauregard Rootintootin Cowboy” Lyndon B. Johnson Klan. ]
Later for the LBJ confederate Yankee Doodle flag-waving “Dixie”-singing parade, he didn’t much care for Black folks himself. His wife, Lurleen, convinced him to honor Kennedy’s memory and do the right thing by signing the papers Kennedy was slated to sign for the second Civil Rights Act of this nation’s history.
By way of note: There are stories surrounding the Kennedy family, too, stories that came out only after their beloved Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy-Onassis herself died and was properly laid to rest, but now isn’t the time or the place to get into it. Read books about America’s Camelot season, you will eventually get it.
I did. And I lived through that era enough to know that most of what is said about how the Kennedys actually thought of Black people is not a lie.
But let’s give JFK his moment in time. He earned it.
At this point, none other than B. Goldwater gets ticked off about how the Dems were bowing down to the winds of time and change, and he reverts himself to the Republican Party, now thoroughly pissed off that Dr. King and his constituency had turned their backs on Republicans for bigger game: Equality, justice, and freedom for all of Black America.
No, not for the right to be gay or to be a white supremacist did Dr. King give his life, his legacy bears no indication that he would have fought for the rights of whites to be racist or for gays to be gay, even as a lover of all humankind. He was a Southern Baptist preacher, so there ain’t no way he’d have co-signed homosexuality during that time except as a man who did not believe in using violence as a way to accomplish anything. That was ALL Barack Obama’s choosing, to be dotted and crossed as the “first Gay president”.
King would have condemned gay slaughter, but would never have condoned their right to marry and be treated as a married couple in the eyes of God. I will never believe that, all things considered in the southern “Bible Belt” that I grew up in.
No one has any right to portray Dr. King in that manner, and I, as a firstfruit beneficiary of the southernmost desegregation that was supposed to put a nail in the coffin of racism in America, I won’t allow white people or anyone else to control that narrative. King’s own children can’t even tell me he would have done that.
I grew up under Liberation Theology coming out of Black churches. I was nine years old when Dr. King was killed and came here to Earth shortly before JFK was murdered. I was a little girl when Malcolm X was assassinated. I was nearly 11 when JFK’s brother, Robert, was assassinated only a year or so after Dr. King. I lived through that entire era and I saw and heard what was going on around me.
I cannot identify with an adult perspective on it during that time, but I know what I perceived as a child. And it turned out, on historical investigation some years later, that I was right.
The question has been raised as to whether or not Black conscious and Christianity can co-exist, because white “jesus” Roman Christianity, not that of the dark-skinned Hebrew converts who came from Jerusalem, has done nothing but made Black people weak and watered down in their effectiveness in the world.
The thing is … turning our backs on God is not a viable answer. It never will be.
There was no white man named “Jesus,” for one thing; and even if you can get away with calling the Son of God what amounts to a transformed Latin cuss word, His Name, the Name Above All Names, was not “jesus” anyway. But we’re still wrapping our brains around the fact that the Son of God who lived and loved on THIS Earth wasn’t white.
I know. I know. Let me wipe away the self-righteous tears of defiance.
That just kills a lot of songs that Black folks sing in traditional and in opulent churches; and most of all, they aren’t ready for that kind of truth. Only the ears of the hearers finally caught on. Black folk, the Churched, are just now, after an entire full generation, ready to admit that The Messiah simply was NOT a white man by any stretch of the imagination, and it wouldn’t have made a difference if He had been.
FOR GOD IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS.
I cannot be made invisible as a Black woman or as a woman of God and of the faith of God, to soothe someone else’s fragile ego about what I heard and saw for myself back when this nation was in total constructive upheaval in the 1960s-1970s.
I ain’t the one to be fooled.
***
That said, Goldwater made his way over to the Republican Party of the 1950s, barreled in by dozens of thousands of despicably angry white men and the Klannish womenfolk, who were dead set on using Black people only for votes and then keeping them race-marginalized under white supremacy.
They try to use Lincoln as “shade” about the GOP’s real motives, but nothing that actually happened during the Civil War supports anything they say.
Believe people when they SHOW you what they are.
Lincoln had no designs on Black freedoms, his hand was pushed and he was left with only two choices: One that would tear the nation asunder, and the other that would make a lot of southern white slavemongering racists mad, but would leave them with no choice but to submit.
It’s 2017, and they haven’t overcome that lost battle yet.
But back to Hillary and the Goldwater Girls, could have been a light-headed girl band for all they were worth.
Not only in 2016 did historical evidence mount against Missus Clinton, but she had brought the sins of their forefathers forward during her campaign against Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination.
Up to that point, Missus Clinton had a lot of Black people willing to forgive the youthful sins of her past, and even more who knew nothing about it.
She had the endorsement of Maya Angelou, a well-respected longtime Black American journalist, writer, stage performer, singer, and Poet Laureate who was organizing for Dr. King on the day that Dr. King was assassinated, that day being also her BIRTHDAY.
But then she (Missus) opened her big fat piehole and stuck a bottle of purse-sized hot sauce in it by commenting that “Bobby Kennedy was killed” while campaigning in Los Angeles, just as then-Senator Obama was on his way to LA to a campaign stumper.
That about killed it.
It appeared to me that even Maya Angelou took up the gauntlet for Barack Obama at that point, and Angelou had been her staunchest celebrity advocate.
Black Vote The Reluctant did not want Donald Trump as President, but they also didn’t have to have much of a forceful gale wind blown at them to admit that the woman who had been a Goldwater Girl in her PAST was NOT the one they wanted to be responsible for helping to elect.
The woman who had once said that Black men were SUPER-predators who needed to be “brought to heel,” whose husband was on watch as President when the largest mass incarceration and proliferation of Ronald Reagan-era crack cocaine drugs infiltrated the Black community, and that even as he attempted to take away the rights of the poorest Black people to protect themselves against the invaders with their white nationalist GUNS. The same one and the same Hillary Clinton had the audacity to show up on a national radio station “playing possum” to a well-known Internet radio host when Black people who really really tried to give her a chance to tell them why they should vote for her.
She screwed even THAT up. My son said he would have told her to show it to him, that hot sauce that she said she keeps in her purse; but … we also know why it wouldn’t have been a good idea for “Charlamagne tha god” to ask her to show it to him, either. He dodged a tempting bullet on that one.
One thing I notated in my book “The United States of Georgia,” was that not only did I discover that what the oppositional whites were saying about her and her ‘crooked’ ways was true, not only did I discover that she had a trail of mysteriously dead bodies attached to her and her husband’s names that wrapped three or four times AROUND THE WORLD in their deceptions, but I also discovered that her husband’s “hot sauce barbecue rib juke joint saxophone-playing ways” with country-fried Black folk didn’t rub off on her to her benefit.
For the first time in my short half a century of life, I discovered that the only thing rich white guys hated WORSE than Barack Obama…was Hillary Clinton.
My own boss, a white southern Baptist sacrilegious GOP-hearting cowboy Lawyer of the racially demented default kind, kind of fluffed off Obama as a strange fluke who had four to eight years to be deflected and blocked and then ‘ razzmatazzed ‘ so that a Black man can never catch them off guard again (and he DID shock them with his win because they had decided his skin color alone would end his bid at the gate); but also I found that when I mentioned Hillary’s name, that well-to-do white man who had been a Georgia lawyer of great renown for umpteen years turned coarse bright scarlet red and started spitting so much spit and teeth that they may as well have been nails.
I’d never in my life seen a white man turning more curse phrases off on a white woman than he did the Black man. It was a first.
It was sealed back then.
I knew that if Hillary ever did run, they were going to go to the Gates of Hell and back and offer satan a big deal to keep her out of office. And they did.
Michael Moore finally picked up on it, but when he said that Hillary Clinton could not win the national election if they screwed Bernie Sanders, and that Trump would be President … I could not even disagree with him.
I’m not horn-tooting, Hillary lost her true base — the Obama voters — by kowtowing to the wrong people at the wrong time in history. She tried to go back to where she left off in 2008 and it was no longer working for her.
You’d have to read my book The United States of Georgia, written in 2008 and published in 2009, to know that I had already called it for Missus Clinton before she ran again. She was damned if she did and damned if she did not, and the Democrat Party messed up BIG when they went for the “I want to see a woman president” okey-doke rather than understand that Black America, ad majorum, were going to side with old white southern racists when it came to Clinton’s rep. The truth is the truth and it don’t care what color told it.
When Moore realized Black people all around him were mythed about Sanders’ loss in the Democratic Party, and that 11-percent of the voters who voted for Barack Obama were bowing out this time, he said “Trump Will Win.” And so he did.
Black people were not going to just show up en masse and “punt the victory ball” for the touchdown for Missus Clinton as they had done for her husband, and even as they tried to do for Al Gore at the last minute down in Florida.
It wasn’t in the cards.
Trump was not written in the stars, either, but the Bible itself speaks of the things that happen when men choose for themselves a king not ordained by God.
There is a price that has to be paid for going against the ultimate authority and will of God to choose the wrong man out of due season, and Trump is most definitely not in his place nor his proper position. But let patience have its perfect work.
Trump was not, by far, one of the WORST racists Black America has seen. He was one amongst a cloud of witnesses as to his character and nature, Goldwater and Johnson and Lincoln included; they would never have left Hillary Clinton’s name out of the conversation on racism even if she had won.
Trump was not the first nor the biggest racist to come our way, but someone is dead-out determined to make sure he is the last of his Tiki torch-bearing inferno breed to darken the doorsteps of The White House, or to enter the doors carved out by the hands of BLACK AMERICAN SLAVES.
The sheep’s wool has been torn off the fox and the wolf. The Lamb will be redeemed.
In the meantime, it is not a time to rest on our laurels; but to work while it is still daylight, as the Will of God will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven: 2018/2019/2020.
End Game.

Conventional wisdom says women will show solidarity at the polls. But new research shows that for white women, having a husband trumped the sisterhood
… Given the opportunity to make history by electing the first female president, women didn’t take it. And ironically, the women who bore the most resemblance to Clinton – white, heterosexual and married – were less likely to vote for her.
Many had expected Clinton to rally women, the same way Barack Obama rallied black voters in 2008 – and if she had, she would have handily trumped Donald Trump. But while Obama won 95% of the black vote, Clinton won just 54% of women – a percentage point less than her male predecessor atop the Democratic ticket. Among white women in particular, she fared even worse: a slim majority voted for Trump.
Last week, Clinton, who has had a lifetime to contemplate the women’s vote, copped to having a theory. “[Women] will be under tremendous pressure – and I’m talking principally about white women. They will be under tremendous pressure from fathers and husbands and boyfriends and male employers not to vote for ‘the girl’,” she said in an interview as part of a tour promoting her new memoir of the 2016 campaign.
If women didn’t have any male loved ones, then Hillary would be President.
… But social science backs up Clinton’s anecdotal hunch. “We think she was right in her analysis about women getting pressure from men in their lives, specifically [straight] white women,” said Kelsy Kretschmer, an assistant professor at Oregon State University and a co-author of a recent study examining women’s voting patterns.
“We know white men are more conservative, so when you’re married to a white man you get a lot more pressure to vote consistent with that ideology.”
The key distinction, according to Kretschmer’s research, is that single women tend to cast votes with the fate of all women in mind, while women married to men vote on behalf of their husbands and families …
Something needs to be done about the existence of heterosexual reproduction. If only women didn’t have any husbands, sons, grandsons, fathers, grandfathers, brothers, uncles, and nephews, then Hillary would be President.
It’s time for some brainstorming: test-tube babies, cloning, Planet of the Women? C’mon, people, Hillary needs some new disruptive ideas.
That could help explain why, despite the fact that the Democratic party is generally considered to have policies more favorable to women, Republicans have traditionally won the votes of married women.
“Just being married makes women more conservative in their vote choice,” said Kretschmer. …
In fact, since men are the primary breadwinners in the vast majority of American families, their wives may well see equality-focused measures as setting their husbands – and therefore their family – back.
“Some married women perceive advances for women, such as lawsuits to mitigate pay discrimination, as coming at the expense of their male partners,” the authors continue. …
A college-educated woman identifying as a liberal Democrat confided to Kretschmer – not wanting to be identified, as a Trump voter – that she had voted for him over Clinton because her husband’s job depends on the coal industry; she saw Trump as the candidate that would protect it, and by extension her family’s economic interests. Kretschmer called her story “the clearest, most heartbreaking validation of our article that I had ever heard”.
Yet the conventional wisdom going into the election, as one Atlantic story summed it up at the time, was that “the 2016 race has turned the battle of the sexes into an all-out war”: Trump and Clinton had divided not just men and women, according to the narrative, but expressly “men and women who are married to each other”. Or so readers were told. …
If every woman in America came home to just a cat and a bottle of white wine, then Hillary would be President.
Is a lifetime of loveless loneliness too much to ask to make Hillary President? Isn’t dying alone worth it if it would make Hillary President?

That’s right, this picture is an embarrassment for both of them. Hillary and Donald have been friends for a long time… sorry, there’s no hiding that!
A Meeting Of Two Bills
Bill Cosby is so toxic to the public eye these days, even posing for an innocent picture with him can land someone of Bill Clinton’s stature in trouble.
Oh God! What Did Bill Do This Time?
Hillary Clinton looking like she’s just found out about another one of Bill Clinton’s “indiscretions.”
This Picture Will Haunt Your Wife, Mr. President
Bill Clinton shaking hands with the sketchiest strongman on Earth, Russian pseudo-dictator, Vladimir Putin.
Predictable Bill
Oh Bill, you were always our favorite President… we could always predict how you’d react to any situation.
Dynasty Love
What’s one political dynasty to do when it meets another political dynasty? Pretend like they like each other, of course.
More Dynasty Love
Bush: “Can you believe they elected my father and then me?!” Bill: “Can you believe they elected me and now they’re going to elect my wife?! Can I get a witness?”
Wandering Eyes
Wow, it looks like Hillary Clinton’s eyes have wandered a bit off course. The camera is this way, Mrs. Clinton!
Bill Will Be Bill
Can you really blame Bill? We already know what kind of man he is… do we really want to change him? Can you imagine how boring the news would be?
Classy, Mr. President, Real Classy
Is That Fear In Hillary’s Eyes?
Could we actually be seeing some fear in the eyes of the first woman who has a decent chance of becoming the most powerful man on Earth?
Bill “Stogie” Clinton
We’re not sure what kind of cigar that is, but we think Bill Clinton has enough money to afford something better than a gas station “Philly.”
Hillary, Back To Her African Roots
BFFFs
That’s right, the Clintons and the Trumps are BFFFs… no, that’s not one too many Fs, we meant it.
If I Wasn’t American, I’d Be A Saudi Princess
Hillary Clinton’s love of Saudi Arabia is only matched by her love of power. We’re not sure if that smug expression on her face is good or bad news for the American people.
Loving That Muslim Culture
Hillary Clinton sporting her best head covering while visiting a muslim country. She looks happy to be celebrating their traditions, doesn’t she?
Golfing With The 1%
The 1% like to keep it in the family… None of the people here have ever had to worry about making a car payment…
I’m NOT A War Hawk? Who You Talkin’ To?!
Hillary Clinton might as well have invented the term, War Hawk. She loves war so much it makes even the Pentagon nervous.
I Love To Hate You
This show of (seemingly) love just goes to prove that there is no love lost between these two politicians. He endorsed her, but they don’t really like each other.
Politipals
Of ALL the Presidents that Bill Clinton could get chummy with and take a picture, he had to pick Dubya?!
Uh Oh!
Hillary has shown her support for the Israelis on countless occasions, so being seen photographed (smiling) with the man viewed as the father of Palestinian revolution is not in her best interest.
Officially In The Republican Crosshairs
This picture will haunt Hillary forever with Republican voters. Not that they would EVER vote for her anyway, but it sure gives them the ammunition they need for their hate-filled agenda.
V For Victory!
Hillary is awfully friendly with a lot of different sorts. Maybe they’re really friends, and maybe not, we can’t be sure.
She Has A Headscarf In All Colors Of The Rainbow
That’s right, Hillary has a headscarf for all occasions and in all colors! Pastels, sure! Rumor has it she even has a plaid one…
“We Love All We’ve Seen On Your Oil… Uh… Soil.”
Fighting for what her constituents want is what Hillary is all about! She’ll make sure they get EXACTLY what they wish. Her constituents… the Oil Companies.
Signing Your Rights Away
Hillary is known as saying what needs to be said. Muslim voters? She says she supports your cause. Hispanic voters? Lots of talk from Hillary. Corporate donors? “I’ll get your laws passed!”
That Looks Awfully Islamic…
The reason Hillary wants this picture to go away is because it might affect her bottom line with some donors of the discriminatory-persuasion…
No, Mrs. Clinton, Thank You…
We’re not quite sure what’s going on in this picture but it looks like the Arab man is refusing a request from Hillary… then again, maybe he’s telling her about his next campaign contribution.
Fake Smiles All Around
When it comes to fake-smile diplomacy, no one is quite as adept as Hillary Clinton. Her fake smiles looks absolutely genuine!
Hillary Must Love These
If there’s one thing Hillary Clinton can appreciate, it’s to see hundreds of pictures of Bill Clinton posing with Monica.
Internship Has Its Rewards
Monica’s internship led to a lot of time in the public light. She’s since dropped off, but she had more than her share of the fabled 15 minutes of fame.
Presidential Collector’s Item
Oh yeah, now we’re talking! There’s Monica Lewinsky’s intern dress for sale. We wonder if Hillary was the winning bidder?
Land Of The Free? Ok, Fine…
Hillary Clinton has risen to levels of power hitherto unseen in American politics. What’s a politician to do?
More Fake Smiliness
“Did you take the picture yet? My face is starting to hurt from this strange expression called a ‘smile’!”
She Was “Broke,” But She Has A Mac
There’s nothing like sporting a new Mac to convince the financially struggling masses that you’re “just like them!”
Poor Bill…
Poor guy has to see THIS every morning! What did he ever do in a past life to deserve this?
Plenty Of Bill Clinton To Go Around
Bill Clinton is a likable guy, we get it. He’s charismatic and very friendly and extremely willing to be photographed with admirers.

https://www.federalisttribune.com/2017/06/13/hacker-breaks-clinton-foundation-database/,Hacker Breaks Into Clinton Foundation Database,"We’ve all been impatient to get out eyes on the highly anticipated Wikileaks announcement, but Julian Assange delayed the release of the supposed bombshell files on Hillary Clinton. Apparently, another hacker just couldn’t wait any longer.
Infamous hacker named Guccifer 2.0 hacked his way into the Clinton Foundation databases and found out some of the most damning evidence to date of the Clinton corruption. Here’s what he said about being impatient and doing some digging himself.
“Many of you have been waiting for this, some even asked me to do it.
So, this is the moment. I hacked the Clinton Foundation server and downloaded hundreds of thousands of docs and donors’ databases.
Hillary Clinton and her staff don’t even bother about the information security. It was just a matter of time to gain access to the Clinton Foundation server.
Here’s the contents of one of the folders that I got from there”
When Barack Obama demanded from Congress to approve more bailouts in 2009-11, it seems the big banks through the Clinton Foundation offered kickbacks to Democratic politicians, including crooked Hillary, to make sure the demand is allowed.
Somehow crooked Hillary also aided the big banks to bribe Democrat politicians, reports Viral Liberty. Guccifer wrote,
“DEMOCRATS FUNNELED TARP FUNDS BACK TO THEIR PACS! That’s taxpayer bailout money that went right to the pockets of Democrat PACs!”
This means that our money went straight to the Democrats and their shady, back handed, back alley deals with the big banks.
“Hillary Clinton and her staff don’t even bother about the information security. It was just a matter of time to gain access to the Clinton Foundation server. It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.”
We cannot allow this kind of corruption and fraudulent practice to continue in Washington. America is floundering and it’s all Democrats’ fault.

President Trump issued his first budget proposal for FY 2018. His plan tracks directly with his campaign promise to put “America First” by eliminating wasteful government spending and reigning in our $21 trillion debt.
Trump’s proposed cuts can be divided into 3 broad categories:
Duplicative services provided by other governmental agencies or programs
Services best delivered by states and localities
Services that could survive on private funding or endowments
These are the 11 agencies President Trump proposed cutting that account for approximately $1.7 billion:
National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities. The arts and humanities are predominately funded through private donations and private foundation endowments.
Corporation for Public Broadcasting – the agency that funds NPR and PBS at the rate of approximately $485 million per year. Considering their success, the President predicts both can find private foundation or other commercial funding to supplement their budget.
Legal Services Corporation. The LSC focuses on lawsuits on behalf of leftist causes and is rife with wasteful spending.
U.S. Trade and Development Agency. This agency was designed to help develop trade with other countries. However, several other governmental agencies are already doing that, so cutting this agency would result in $594 million over 10 years.
Woodrow Wilson International Program for Scholars. This program provides scholarships in humanities and social services and costs approximately $11 million per year. There are many private endowments that could step up to provide these types of scholarships.
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. This agency monitors “Neighborworks” programs that provide affordable housing in several areas, which is also a job for HUD. The duplication can be cut and save $175 million per year.
Denali Commission. This is a quintessential example of a “pet project.” The late Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) formed this commission in 1998 to provide infrastructure for Native Americans. Obama refused to cut it so he can use it as a way to “combat climate change.” This is $14 million in unnecessary spending.
U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. This council coordinates with 20 departments and agencies to develop policies to solve homelessness. The function is duplicated in many other government agencies, so here’s another $4 million that can be saved.
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. This board investigates chemical accidents and develops preventive measures to avoid them, which overlaps with OSHA, EPA, and NTSB. The cut will save $11 million a year.
Overseas Private Investment Corporation. This was originally designed to promote and encourage private investment in developing countries. Today, there are many private businesses that facilitate investment in developing countries. Its elimination will save $63 million per year.
Institute of Museum and Library Services. This agency provides funding to the nation’s libraries and museums. President Trump believes this is a function best served by states and local governments. Eliminating this at the federal level will save $231 million per year.

Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley has opened an investigation that should determine whether Hillary Clinton acted to prevent a Bangladeshi probe into a Clinton Foundation donor.
Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, requested information from the State Department regarding possible interference into a corruption investigation into Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi banker and economist who is also a close friend of the Clintons.
During her time at the State Department, Clinton reportedly pressured Bangladesh to stop a probe into Yunus and Grameen Bank. The son of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina even stated that he had been threatened with an IRS audit if the investigation was not dropped.
“As I wrote in my August 2016 letter to Department of Justice, federal law requires that executive branch employees be disqualified from matters that have a direct and predictable effect on the employee’s own financial interests or the financial interests of those persons or organizations with which the employee is affiliated, such as those of a spouse, unless the employee first obtains an individual waiver or a regulatory exemption applies,” Grassley said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
“Once again, Secretary Clinton’s actions have raised reasonable suspicions that she violated these rules and undermined the public’s confidence in the integrity of the State Department.”
“If the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States, then that would be unacceptable,” he added.
“Co-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate. It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation.”
If Grassley goes forward with his look into the Grameen Bank affair, it would be the first major post-election congressional inquiry into either the Democrat presidential nominee or the Clinton Foundation.

The NBC investigation provided internal State Department memos to back up claims of a massive Hillary Clinton elite pedophile ring cover-up.
“Serious allegations concerning the State Department,” the NBC anchor Chuck Todd announced, before launching into the disturbing details that mainstream media will refuse to report on in 2017.
“According to internal State Department memos the agency might have called off or intervened into investigations into possibly illegal, inappropriate behavior within it’s ranks allegedly to protect jobs and avoid scandals.
“This concerns a time when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.”
“There is an old saying in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime. But in this case both parts of it are disturbing,” Todd continued.
“Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia, and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into. So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims, and those investigations involve misconduct by State Department officials, including an Ambassador and security agents attached to then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.”
“The allegations are that these investigations were whitewashed, quashed altogether, and that those orders came from high up.”
“NBC has obtained documents relating to ongoing investigations into some disturbing allegations involving State Department personnel and at least one ambassador. A State Department memo says, quote, ‘the Ambassador routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children.’”
“The memo also says a top State Department official directed State Department investigators to ‘cease the investigation’ into the ambassador’s conduct. It’s just one of what another document describes as ‘several examples of undue influence’ from top State Department officials.”
President Trump has announced a federal investigation into the elite pedophile scandal involving human trafficking and promised to help put an end to the “horrific, really horrific crimes taking place.”
The president informed that he will direct “the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies” to devote more resources and personnel to the investigation.
Trump said that the issue has been on the radar of federal government “for some time” but since taking office in January the investigation has become “much more focused.”
“It has been much more focused over the last four weeks, I can tell you that.”

Two Muslim men from Dearborn, Michigan and New York City have been arrested for plotting a terrorist attack on American soil.
U.S. authorities inform that a foreign terrorist organization gave explicit orders to these men to find potential targets in New York and Panama.
The arrested men are Samer El Debek, 37, of Dearborn, Michigan, and Ali Kourani, 32, from the Bronx, New York. In a Manhattan federal court, both were charged with “providing support to a terrorist organization.”
Both men were directly linked to Hezbollah’s “Islamic Jihad organization” following military training provided by the entity, reports The Truth Division. Reportedly, they were attempting to supply support for Hezbollah. In order to do that, El Debek was looking for targets in Panama, including American and Israeli embassies. He was also supposed to find out how close someone could get to the ships that pass through the Panama Canal and if there was potentially a flaw, or exploitable weakness, in the construction. Kourani spent his time finding American targets, “including military and law enforcement facilities in New York City”.
According to the authorities, El Debek has told the FBI that he was detained by Hezbollah from December 2015 until April 2016 after he was falsely accused of spying for the United States. It has been discovered that from late 2014 until February, El Debek has conducted over 250 Facebook searches with words including “martyrs of the holy defense,” ”martyrs of Islamic resistance” and “martyrs of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon.”
William F. Sweeney Jr., head of the New York FBI office, said the charges “reveal once again that the New York City region remains a focus of many adversaries, demonstrated as alleged in this instance by followers of a sophisticated and determined organization with a long history of coordinating violent activities on behalf of Hezbollah.”

Barack Hussein Obama thought he got it all figured out for his retirement, raking in millions on the paid speaking circuit while also getting an annual $400,000 pension. Unfortunately for Obama, however, Congress just gave him some very bad news.
A bill that was once vetoed by Obama is now being re-introduced by Congress, and it may cut Obama’s pension if he exceeds $400,000 per year mark.
So, the same bill he once dismissed could now cause major trouble to Barrack Obama as he has decided to accept $400,000 for an upcoming speech. While he was President of the United States, Obama had the opportunity to try and cut down on government waste and to actually make a step forward the improvement of the economy. He not only didn’t go ahead, but he VETOED the legislation, because that would end his robbing days. He just looked the other way and kept stealing off the American people.
“The Obama hypocrisy on this issue is revealing,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and sponsor of the 2016 bill. “His veto was very self-serving.”
Chaffetz and Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, are the sponsors of the companion Senate bill. They are getting ready to re-introduce the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act in hopes that President Trump will sign it. This bill would cap presidential pensions at $200,000 and give them another $200,000 for expenses, reports MRCBlog. Last summer, the bill passed both the House and the Senate with no opposition, before Obama vetoed it.
Obama made a ridiculous excuse for not signing the bill, arguing that it could have “unintended consequences” and “impose onerous and unreasonable burdens” on former presidents by requiring them to immediately lay off staff and find new office space.
If this bill can make it through the House and Senate again, Trump will undoubtedly sign it, as he actually cares for his country and its citizens…for a change.

Comey testified on Capiton Hill and President Trump took it to Twitter on Friday morning to express his opinion on Comey’s testimony.
After the testimony, many are saying that Comey will have brought an investigation on himself. The President’s attorney, Marc Kasowitz, is planning on filing a complaint against James Comey based on Comey’s own admission, on live TV, because he leaked memos to the press after the President canned him!
Even the Senator who is questioning Comey said that is was a cowardly act to give the memo to someone else to give to the press. Comey’s actions show how weak and full of excuses he really is. He’s a self-serving coward that is still bitter about the fact he was fired.
Trump also tweeted this out recently:
Comey says it was not him who gave the memo to the New York Times, it was his friend, but that still makes him 100% responsible for the unauthorized disclosure of privileged information to the press. Trump’s attorney said:
“Although Mr. Comey testified that he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet, the public record reveals that the New York Times was quoting from those memos the day before the referenced tweet, which belies Mr. Comey’s excuse for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information and appears to be entirely retaliatory.”
So that makes Comey a liar, too!

James Comey revealed that one of CNN’s stories was based on a false narrative and CNN was forced to make a retraction because their trusted anonymous sources got it wrong once again.
On Thursday, former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of their investigation into connections between Russia and the Trump 2016 campaign. This made the “Russiagate” hysteria reach a new height.
Comey might have been in the mainstream media’s headlines, but what he said forced one major outlet to admit that its trusted “anonymous” sources had the wrong information.
On Wednesday morning, CNN tweeted that in his testimony, “Comey will dispute President Trump’s blanket claim that he was told he wasn’t under investigation.”
In testimony, Comey will dispute President Trump’s blanket claim that he was told he wasn’t under investigation https://t.co/MlUtMftebc pic.twitter.com/dbtmcsDvtR
— CNN (@CNN) June 7, 2017
What Comey said about President Trump disputed CNN’s claim:
“I discussed with the FBI’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-Elect Trump’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.”
Following the changes, CNN updated their story and wrote this:
“CORRECTION AND UPDATE: This article was published before Comey released his prepared opening statement. The article and headline have been corrected to reflect that Comey does not directly dispute that Trump was told multiple times he was not under investigation in his prepared testimony released after this story was published.”
Once, anonymous sources were used for the purpose of releasing vital information, while protecting the source’s identity from harm. After CNN’s latest retraction, which was based on claims made by an alleged anonymous source, it’s made clear that the tradition has been used and abused by the mainstream media.

As time passes, we receive new evidence that shows just how shady and corrupt the Obama White House was. As it turns out, the Obama administration that was involved in leaking Hillary Clinton’s emails.
According to reports, even though Obama said he first learned about Clinton’s emails through the media, a State Department official, Patrick Kennedy, was trying to re-classify Clinton’s emails.
With this new evidence, it’s clear that Obama officials were working hard to remove the “Secret” and “Top Secret” classifications from Clinton’s leaked emails in an attempt to undercut the scandal. They were working overtime to keep Clinton from going to jail.
Other reports show that Obama’s minions and Clinton campaign aides knew Hillary broke the law, but they voted to “clean up” the mess instead of pursuing justice. Of course, there aren’t reports made by the mainstream media.
Some suspect that by 2015, the Obama State Department and the FBI had already destroyed the worst of Clinton’s leaked emails. They were being careful in case something leaked.
Obama might have worked so hard to hide Hillary’s secrets because there might be a mutual disdain between the Clintons and Obama played a role in how the scandal was handled. A lot of people think that this is very likely.
A email dump that was revealed around 2016 released private emails between Colin Powell and Democratic mega donor Jeffrey Leeds that openly discussed how much Bill and Hillary hate Obama. The Clintons even referred to him as ‘that man.’
Since we know Obama can be really petty, it’s no shock that he would deliberately sabotage an enemy or opponent. In this case, Obama’s corrupt and vile nature backfired, and his efforts only served to push Clinton’s illegal activities into the spotlight.

Gary Sinise is a well known actor who has built quite a career for himself on the big screen as well as in television and on stage. But, his personal role as a booster of the United States Army has been the closes to his heart.
Gary is a known advocate for veteran’s groups and has supported organizations that help out active duty service men and women as well. In the past, he has been an instantly recognizable voice to the US Army for ad campaigns. Because of all he has done, he is now being honored with a very special award.
According to reports, Gary Sinis will be awarded the highest military honor a civilian can earn by the US Army – the Marshall Medal. The medal is given to those who have demonstrated “selfless service to the United States of America” in “more than one area or under extraordinary circumstances.”
Gary has helped many members of the armed forces. He even started his own foundation, the Gary Sinise Foundation, with a mission to help “defenders, veterans, first responders, and their families” by “creating and supporting unique programs designed to entertain, educate, inspire, strengthen, and build communities.”
Several highly regarded programs have been launched through his foundation. Some of them are: R.I.S.E. which provided specially designed homes for veterans who have been severely wounded, Soaring Valor which helps World War II veterans visit the National Museum in New Orleans, and Relief & Outreach, a program that helps veterans recover from trauma.
Gary is on the board of directors for Hope for the Warriors, a nonprofit organization that provides non-medical care to wounded service members and their families, as well as the families of those who have been killed.
After the news that he will be the recipient of this prestigious honor, Sinise issued a public statement saying:
“I am honored to be invited to receive the George Catlett Marshall Medal from the Association of the United States Army. It has been a great blessing to know there is something I can do to support the men and women in uniform who defend our nation and I will look forward to expressing my gratitude in person at the Marshall Dinner.”

By now we’ve all heard the ridiculous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to rig the election. This foolishness is doing two things:
It is exasperating the Democrats as they scrabble around for any shred of proof to show that they were justified in making this whole thing up.
As people dig deeper and deeper, it turns out that there was some dodgy activity taking place…but it was the Democrats doing it.
Senator Mark Warner just had an interview with Jake Tapper and he accidentally ditched the whole Trump Russia collusion idea. He confessed that there is no “Smoking Gun” evidence that Donald Trump did something wrong.
The question now is – why are the MSM still going on about it when there is no evidence despite searching since November? After it was revealed that the DNC data was actually stolen by murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, and after the announcement that sensitive data has been passed to the MSM by holdovers from the Obama administration on “UNSECURED SERVERS”, it seems like there could be a lot of heads rolling over this investigation.
The thing we would all like to know is where these rumours came from in the first place. As most people already suspect, it was likely dreamed up by John Podesta and Hillary Clinton to try and overturn her shocking loss.

Donald and Melania Trump have been living separately because they wanted Barron to finish off the fifth grade in his current school in New York City. But now, just in time for President Trump’s birthday on June 14th, Melania and Barron will be moving into the White House.
Melania Trump’s parents, who currently live in Trump Tower with her and Barron, will visiting the White House frequently to take care of young Barron. Trump supporters everywhere are very happy to hear this. An former aide said:
“I’m very happy she’s moving here. She’s a strong influence and personality, and I think she comforts him.”
Barron, who is 11 years old, will begin school in the fall at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School in Maryland. This will enable the whole family to be in one place, which is great because the Trumps are a very close family and they enjoy being with each other.
It is still unknown what kind of place Melania will make for herself in the White House- how many events she will attend or what kind of initiatives she might start. She had a wonderful start with President Trump’s first foreign trips to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Italy We love her and we know she is going to be a great First Lady!

On Friday morning, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi confused audience members and journalists when she called George W. Bush “a bully” and forgot Donald Trump’s name.
During a press conference, the former Speaker of the House kept referring to Donald Trump as “Bush.” This is part of what she said:
“Follow this […] New Yorkers have said to me, those that have had business dealings with him, he operates this way. First, he tries to charm you, President Bush tries to charm you.
If that doesn’t work he tries to bully you. if that doesn’t work he tries to walk away from the deal. And if that doesn’t work he sues you. So, charm, bully, abandon, sue.”
After a while, an aide handed Pelosi a cheat sheet informing her that Donald Trump was actually the President, and not Bush. She than said:
“Did I say President Bush? I’m sorry, I meant to say… um, it’s hard for me to say it. Poor President Bush, I apologize.”

This Thursday was the hearing of former FBI Director James Comey at a Senate Intelligence Committee. During this hearing, Senator John McCain made several misstatements.
McCain mixed two separate FBI probes – the first one was an ongoing investigation of the Russian state’s alleged political interference during 2016’s presidential campaign season; the second one was an apparently closed investigation of Hillary Clinton’s negligent handling of classified intelligence during her secretaryship at the State Department.
McCain also twice referred to Comey as ‘President.’ Watch the moment here:

McCain said this shortly after Thursday’s SIC hearing:
“I get the sense from Twitter that my line of questioning today went over people’s heads. Maybe going forward I shouldn’t stay up late watching the Diamondbacks night games.”

The Guantanamo Bay facility is of great importance because the extremely dangerous and vicious terrorists caged there were captured at great risk to our soldiers. Sometimes soldiers even lost their lives to catch these high value intelligence sources alive.
Former president Barack Obama has been doing everything possible to release these terrorists. To this day, he has sneaked out 80% of these terrorists, allowing them to return to jihad.
Soon everyone will know about what Obama did because Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas introduced legislation that will release information about the Guantanamo Bay detainees President Barack Obama has transferred since Nov. 8. Some speculate that even 30 percent of transferred detainees have reengaged in terrorist activities. Cruz said in a statement Tuesday:
“Even though the American people rightly rejected President Obama’s dangerous plan to completely empty the Guantanamo detention facility, he is still irresponsibly working to release as many terrorists as possible before he leaves office. President Obama’s push to empty GTMO is reckless, and the American people should be made aware of the past terrorist activities committed by the individuals detained there.”
Here’s part of the information that has come out inspite of Obama:
“Some of the recommended transfers have also vowed to return to jihad if they are ever released, according to reports from US military officials. They have also threatened to assassinate the U.S. president, kill American citizens, and attack other world leaders who are allied with the West.
Muieen Abdal Sattar, an accused al Qaeda member who fought in Tora Bora, has been at Guantanamo for 14 years and 11 months. While there he has ‘incited mass disturbances, assaulted and threatened to kill [Gitmo] personnel and made motivational speeches to ‘fight against infidels’ and to kill all Americans to include men, women, children, and babies,’ according to US military officials.”
Watch a video of Obama trying to rationalize this horrific agenda here.

It’s a fact that politics can be divided to people who understand it and those who don’t. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is one of the few good people who’s opinion we care about. During an interview on CBS’s “Face The Nation” on Sunday, he said this about President Trump:
“Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven’t seen.”
The liberals and people in general who favor Clinton will never admit that Donald Trump was clearly the man with the right vision for America. Still, what Donald Trump has done for this country will forever be remembered. He is the best thing America has seen in quite a while. Kissinger said:
“Every country now has to consider two things. One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities.
And secondly, that here is a new president who’s asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it.”
Many people assume Trump will put America first, but neglect the rest of the world in the process. That is far from the truth. Trump is an expert negotiator who has worked with people from all over the world. No doubt he will develop strategies for our foreign relations that will be amicable to all.

https://www.federalisttribune.com/2017/06/16/top-official-john-ashe-scheduled-testify-hillary-found-dead/,Top Official John Ashe Scheduled To Testify Against Hillary Found Dead,"A former United Nations official that was linked to a current corruption scandal involving Hillary Clinton died this weekend in a weight lifting accident. What a conveniently timed death.
The disgraced UN official John Ashe died from a barbell. This is possibly a bigger obsession for conspiracy theorists than Vince Foster’s 1993 suicide.
On Wednesday, Ashe was found dead from in his house in Westchester County. Police said that his throat had been crushed, presumably by a barbell he dropped while pumping iron.
Ashe was supposed to appear in court on Monday with Ng Lap Seng, his Chinese businessman co-defendant, who is charged with smuggling $4.5 million into the US since 2013 and lying that it was to buy art and casino chips.
According to reports, Ng was illegally funneling thousands of dollars through an Arkansas restaurant owner, Charlie Trie, to the Democratic National Committee during the Clinton administration, but he was never charged. However, he and Trie were photographed multiple times with Bill and Hillary Clinton.
A source said:
“During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman Ng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed.”

The Democratic Party has many crooked and corrupt members. The latest example is Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois who has been misusing campaign cash.
According to reports, Rep. Bobby Rush has paid both his wife and the church he founded hundreds of thousands of dollars from his campaign’s coffers since 2002.
The campaign finance records show that additionally to paying his family, he gave more $14 million in taxpayer-backed government grants to a wellness center associated with the church he founded in Chicago.
Rush first was elected to Congress in 1992, but started paying his wife in 2002. During the election cycle, more than $67,231 in payments were made to her name.
From 2002 to 2004, she received $6,000. She started receiving checks for “consulting services” in 2008 and got $98,650 from the committee. The payments became even higher in 2010, when they reached $119,400. She was paid $148,000 in 2012. She took in $66,000 in 2014. From the 2016 campaign she collected $50,000.
It’s very interesting how to media doesn’t post anything about this. If this was about a Trump-supported, it would have been all over the headlines.

Even with the national debt and the shocking number of people on government programs, liberals still think Obama did a good job as president. In reality, a good president helps restore the economy instead of making it easy for more and more people to take instead of give.
A good nation is a nation where people work to earn a living and support their families. They take ownership of their own lives.
A bad nation is a nation where people live on food stamps. That’s what is happening in America at the moment.
Ever since Trump became President, we see jobs coming back into the country, the stock market is booming,companies have promised to invest in American labor. Trump is working to get the federal budget under control. He is reforming government handout programs.
As of April 2016, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has almost 43.6 million people getting food stamps. Some of the people who get food stamps are convicted sex offenders and murderers. But, they will no longer be receiving food stamps. Additionally, lottery winners will be prevented from being on welfare while benefitting from their cash prize.
Under Obama, murderers, sex offenders and lottery or gambling addicts were getting free food. That will no longer be the case. Liberals loved to punish hard-working tax payers to reward child molesters and gamblers, but President Trump will change all that.

http://www.unz.com/article/on-the-criminal-referral-of-comey-clinton-et-al/,"On the Criminal Referral of Comey, Clinton et al","Wednesday’s criminal referral by 11 House Republicans of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as well as several former and serving top FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) officials is a giant step toward a Constitutional crisis.
Named in the referral to the DOJ for possible violations of federal law are: Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey; former Attorney General Loretta Lynch; former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; FBI Agent Peter Strzok; FBI Counsel Lisa Page; and those DOJ and FBI personnel “connected to” work on the “Steele Dossier,” including former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente.
With no attention from corporate media, the referral was sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah John Huber. Sessions appointed Huber months ago to assist DOJ Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz. By most accounts, Horowitz is doing a thoroughly professional job. As IG, however, Horowitz lacks the authority to prosecute; he needs a U.S. Attorney for that. And this has to be disturbing to the alleged perps.
This is no law-school case-study exercise, no arcane disputation over the fine points of this or that law. Rather, as we say in the inner-city, “It has now hit the fan.” Criminal referrals can lead to serious jail time. Granted, the upper-crust luminaries criminally “referred” enjoy very powerful support. And that will come especially from the mainstream media, which will find it hard to retool and switch from Russia-gate to the much more delicate and much less welcome “FBI-gate.”
As of this writing, a full day has gone by since the letter/referral was reported, with total silence so far from T he New York Times and The Washington Post and other big media as they grapple with how to spin this major development. News of the criminal referral also slipped by Amy Goodman’s non-mainstream DemocracyNow!, as well as many alternative websites.
The 11 House members chose to include the following egalitarian observation in the first paragraph of the letter conveying the criminal referral: “Because we believe that those in positions of high authority should be treated the same as every other American, we want to be sure that the potential violations of law outlined below are vetted appropriately.” If this uncommon attitude is allowed to prevail at DOJ, it would, in effect, revoke the de facto “David Petraeus exemption” for the be-riboned, be-medaled, and well-heeled.
Meanwhile, the patience of the chairmen of House committees investigating abuses at DOJ and the FBI is wearing thin at the slow-rolling they are encountering in response to requests for key documents from the FBI. This in-your-face intransigence is all the more odd, since several committee members have already had access to the documents in question, and are hardly likely to forget the content of those they know about. (Moreover, there seems to be a good chance that a patriotic whistleblower or two will tip them off to key documents being withheld.)
The DOJ IG, whose purview includes the FBI, has been cooperative in responding to committee requests for information, but those requests can hardly include documents of which the committees are unaware.
Putting aside his partisan motivations, House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) was unusually blunt two months ago in warning of legal consequences for officials who misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to enable surveillance on Trump and his associates. Nunes’s words are likely to have sent chills down the spine of those with lots to hide: “If they need to be put on trial, we will put them on trial,” he said.”The reason Congress exists is to oversee these agencies that we created.”
Whether the House will succeed in overcoming the resistance of those criminally referred and their many accomplices and will prove able to exercise its Constitutional prerogative of oversight is, of course, another matter — a matter that matters.
And Nothing Matters More Than the Media
The media will be key to whether this Constitutional issue is resolved. Largely because of Trump’s own well earned reputation for lying, most Americans are susceptible to slanted headlines like this recent one — “Trump escalates attacks on FBI …” — from an article in The Washington Post, commiserating with the treatment accorded fired-before-retired prevaricator McCabe and the FBI he (dis)served.
Nor is the Post above issuing transparently clever warnings — like this one in a lead article on March 17: “Some Trump allies say they worry he is playing with fire by taunting the FBI. ‘This is open, all-out war. And guess what? The FBI’s going to win,’ said one ally, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. ‘You can’t fight the FBI. They’re going to torch him.’” [sic]
Mind-Boggling Criminal Activity
What motivated the characters now criminally “referred” is clear enough from a wide variety of sources, including the text messages exchange between Strzok and Page. Many, however, have been unable to understand how these law enforcement officials thought they could get away with taking such major liberties with the law.
None of the leaking, unmasking, surveillance, “opposition research,” or other activities directed against the Trump campaign can be properly understood, if one does not bear in mind that it was considered a sure thing that Secretary Clinton would become President, at which point illegal and extralegal activities undertaken to help her win would garner praise, not prison. The activities were hardly considered high-risk, because candidate Clinton was sure to win.
But she lost.
Comey himself gives this away in the embarrassingly puerile book he has been hawking, “A Higher Loyalty” — which
amounts to a pre-emptive move motivated mostly by loyalty-to-self, in order to obtain a Stay-Out-of-Jail card. Hat tip to Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone for a key observation, in his recent article, “James Comey, the Would-Be J. Edgar Hoover,” about what Taibbi deems the book’s most damning passage, where Comey discusses his decision to make public the re-opening of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
Comey admits, “It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the re-started investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in the polls.”
The key point is not Comey’s tortured reasoning, but rather that Clinton was “sure to be the next president.” This would, of course, confer automatic immunity on those now criminally referred to the Department of Justice. Ah, the best laid plans of mice and men — even very tall men. One wag claimed that the “Higher” in “A Higher Loyalty” refers simply to the very tall body that houses an outsized ego.
I think it can be said that readers of Consortiumnews.com may be unusually well equipped to understand the anatomy of FBI-gate as well as Russia-gate. Listed below chronologically are several links that might be viewed as a kind of “whiteboard” to refresh memories. You may wish to refer them to any friends who may still be confused.
Ray McGovern works with Tell the Word, a publishing arm of the ecumenical Church of the Saviour in inner-city Washington.

http://www.unz.com/isteve/the-hillary-clinton-book-club/,Hillary Explains Orwell for Us,"“This is what happens in George Orwell’s classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, when a torturer holds up four fingers and delivers electric shocks until his prisoner sees five fingers as ordered. The goal is to make you question logic and reason and to sow mistrust toward exactly the people we need to rely on: our leaders, the press, experts who seek to guide public policy based on evidence, ourselves.”
Why didn’t I ever notice before that the theme of 1984 is that we should trust “our leaders” more?
This could make a good SNL skit if they were still in the market for funny stuff about politicians: as part of the healing process, Hillary joins a Chappaqua ladies reading circle, but every single book turns out to be, in her intensely felt interpretations, about herself:
What Heinlein is showing us in Starship Troopers is that if military veterans were the only people allowed to vote, then terrible, trashy, white developers wouldn’t get elected, just selfless, competent women.",hillary

If this election is a referendum – and it is on Obamacare, the Second Amendment, fair and equitable trade, tax reform, globalization, constitutionalism, the economy, et al – then it should also be a referendum on the mainstream media.
On November 8th vote Trump. On November 8th vote against the mainstream media.

I read these comments with interest. I know there are clinton staffers whose job it is to go online and act as trump supporters and comment with really stupid comments. I think I found a few in here. I am a trump supporter, I am not a racist nor are my friends who support Trump nor are my Co workers who also support trump. We don't hate blacks or Hispanics or asians. We welcome them to the reality of the lies the dems have dished out for decades. All the promises to make things better for minorities in the inner cities and better education. ...

The media also failed to report a March in downtown Birmingham, Alabama 8-28-2015 of an estimated 30,000 black, white, Hispanic, and Asian
in support of ""All Lives Matter!""
That apparently did not satisfy their p.c. agenda.

There are people on here that are spewing hate. The people I know who are voting for Trump want all lives of Americans lifted up. We are tired of politicians causing division among all of us. We want to see people with jobs who can hold their heads up high and be able to support their families with real jobs. We are sending our good jobs to other countries and watching our own live in squalor and crumbs given to us by the government. Stop with the crumbs, we want a whole piece of the cake. We all deserve the American Dream.

Another non-racist Trump supporter here. Grew up in NYC in the 80's, friends of all colors and races and sexualities. All for legal immigration and I will never deny someone a job or not do business with someone because of things they cannot control. I know so many people voting for Trump, including many women, and I still live in NYC, I really don't believe the polls that show Trump so far behind. Is my social circle that different that Trump supporters outnumber Hillary supporters 2 to 1 in one of the most liberal cities in this country? I really doubt this video's title is accurate but I do know the media has ignored the Haitians protesting the Clintons so that much is true.

So tired of seeing how the liberals have treated all Americans and especially black Americans for decades. I want to see ALL Americans have a chance to succeed and achieve their potential. ALL Americans of ALL colors. I want to see ALL Americans take back their lives and their country from the filthy politicians in DC and in our towns and cities. Great video and so glad black people are waking up to the truth that liberals do not care about them or anyone and have proved it by their lack of action on their behalf. Donald Trump will be a President for ALL the people.

Lisa Futvoye-Shepherd • 9 months ago View Hide As did most of my generation after Vietnam, thinking war was over and all was good in the world, we all got busy raising families and trying to keep a roof over our heads, clothes on our backs and food in our mouths while The Powers That Be continued to make doing just that, more and more and more difficult.
All the while, via television, newspapers and advertising, convincing us that THIS is the way it ""Ought to be""....... And we believed them.
However, THIS time around, at this point in history, the Powers That Be have played it FAR more intelligently.
This time, there is NO draft to be protested against. To raise the ire of the ""puny peasants"". They just crashed the economy to such an extent that those from the poor and blue collar classes...and many from the middle class as well, CHOSE to join the military as their ""best option"". Brilliant strategy if you think about it.
Ah, but then came the Internet. The Powers That Be NEVER foresaw THAT in their, a century in the making, globalist/banker plan. Just as King George never realized the power of the printing press prior to the American Revolution.
Which is precisely why after the ""Shot heard round the world"" at the start of the American Revolution, one of the very first actions King George mandated, was to confiscate or onerously tax each and every printing press. Quite similar to the FCC taking over control of the Intenet in the USA (the vaunted ""Net Neutrality"" we had quickly thrust upon us last year), then Obama recently blithely handing over the administration and control of the global Internet to the United Nations without - a - single - shot - at - all.
We're ALL being played. And we've been played exquisitely since the start of the Federal Reserve in 1913. We are being played on a GLOBAL scale by the Central Banking System.
The Elites, The Globalists, the Banksters and the MegaCorps as well as the rampaging, progressive, mercenary minions rioting in the streets...are all terrified at the possibility of a #Trump presidency.
#Trump as President would put ""sand in the gears"", put a screaming halt to the Elites' slow motion, devious, globalist takeover of our government and country. Perhaps even our world?
The Globalist/Banksters worldwide financial ponzi scheme has come to it's inevitable, mathematical end. Historically, the next move has ALWAYS been war. Wars are always profitable when financed by both sides.
WWI, WWII...and now these megalomaniacal Globalists see no other option but to go for WWIII. Why do you think they need Hillary in power?
With Hillary as President, the USA will have been shackled by the control of the same two families, for over 30 years.
Obama was merely a distraction.
Ah, but with Obama they certainly chose this particular puppet president quite well. Any criticism whatsoever and ""RACIST"" was readily claimed. Suited their agenda perfectly.
Bankrupting the United States is a planned strategy.
Well played Globalist Elites, well played.

You can still see it in Google’s cache:
Their 12-year affair made Gennifer Flowers one of the most high profile mistresses in America. Now, two decades after they split amid scandal, the former news reporter from Little Rock, Arkansas wants to ‘sit down and talk’ with Bill Clinton.
In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Gennifer has spoken of her deep regret at turning down Clinton’s pleas to talk some eight years ago and revealed her belief that they would still be together today, were it not the birth of Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea.
. . . Clinton, now 67, also shared a lot of intimacies regarding his marriage to Hillary.
They left Gennifer in no doubt that the union is far from ‘traditional.’
She said: ‘What they have is very strong.
‘It obviously worked for them but I’ve never considered theirs a traditional marriage.’
When rumours surfaced recently of an affair between Hillary Clinton and her transition office chief, Huma Abedin, 37, Gennifer was not surprised.
The rumours concerning Huma, wife of disgraced former Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, 49, emerged as she stood by her husband in the wake of his recent ‘sexting’ scandal.
Revelations that he had sent intimate pictures of himself and steamy messages to 23-year-old Sydney Leathers – a girl he had only ever ‘met’ online – finally did for his New York Mayoral campaign last week.
The scandal broke almost exactly a year after the shamed congressman suffered a public mauling for the same behaviour. Then, as recently, his wife Huma Abedin stood by him.
This time round Huma’s loyalty raised eyebrows and questions over why a woman of such accomplishment would stick by a man so apparently incapable of change.
Gennifer said: ‘I don’t know Huma or the Weiners. I just know what Bill told me and that was that he was aware that Hillary was bisexual and he didn’t care. He should know.
‘He said Hillary had eaten more pussy than he had.’
The Daily Mail makes no mention of the article being altered. Post-scrubbing it looks like this:
Update: Just sayin’
(Politico) — As a student at The George Washington University in 1996, Huma Abedin began working as a White House intern assigned to then first lady Hillary Clinton. The two have been together since, wth Abedin traveling the country as Clinton’s “bodywoman” throughout her 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination campaign. She later became Clintons’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department, and still works for her transitional team, assisting the former secretary of state’s move back into her private life.
Update: It’s baaaack!
. . . Gennifer said: ‘I don’t know Huma or the Weiners. I just know what Bill told me and that was that he was aware that Hillary was bisexual and he didn’t care. He should know.
‘He said Hillary had eaten more p***y than he had.’

Andrew Weissmann’s attendance at the party is one of many signs pointing to a troubling bias from the attorney. Weissmann has been described by The New York Times as Mueller’s “lieutenant” and “pit bull.”
Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained an email Tuesday that reveled Weissmann praised former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates’ defiance of Trump.
“I am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects,” Weissmann wrote to Yates on Jan. 30. The email followed Yates’ instruction to the DOJ not to defend an executive order banning immigration from seven nations, an act that led to her dismissal by President Trump.",hillary

President Trump has a knack for getting long-forgotten political actors to act like they’re still relevant.
The President’s foreign policy has been one of the most common targets of his detractors. Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State under Bill Clinton, co-wrote a scathing CNN op-ed calling on Congress to circumvent President Trump by asserting greater foreign policy powers.
Albright’s article, titled “It’s time for Congress to override Trump’s foreign policy powers,” was co-written by Rep. David E. Price (D-NC), who is the ranking member of the House Democracy Partnership.
The former Clinton official evoked history, describing moments in which Congress put a check on the Executive Branch’s foreign policy.
“Senate hearings on the Vietnam War played a decisive role in turning public opinion against the conflict and accelerating the US troop withdrawal. During Ronald Reagan’s administration, Congress uncovered and reversed the President’s policy of covert support for anti-leftist militias in Central America, and delivered a bipartisan rebuke of his policy toward apartheid South Africa.”

When former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and President Bill Clinton were busted secretly meeting aboard Lynch’s private plane last summer by a local television reporter, a number of government watchdog groups filed lawsuits for documents surrounding the meeting. After all the FBI, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, was actively investigating Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information at the time. In response to information requests, the FBI and DOJ said documents didn’t exist.
Fast forward more than a year and it turns out hundreds of documents related to the meeting do exist and show the Department was in a panic over how to respond to inquiries about why the meeting took place.

After all, isn’t everyone ultimately guilty for not realizing her great brilliance? Reading what she says is like a refresher course in why never to vote for this delusional crazy woman.
Via Washington Examiner:
Failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in her book due out Tuesday blames a new culprit for contributing to her election loss: Chief Justice John Roberts.
A source who obtained a copy of the book shared a passage from Clinton’s book “What Happened” that describes her election loss as a consequence of Roberts’ actions on the Supreme Court. Clinton writes on page 419 of the forthcoming book that “Trump actively tried to discourage people from voting at all. They used some of the same tactics as the Russians, including trafficking in fake news and under-the-radar Facebook attacks. Despicable stuff.
“But whatever Trump was up to was just the latest in a long-term Republican strategy to discourage and disenfranchise Democratic-leaning voters,” she continues. “The Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts opened the floodgates by gutting the Voting Rights Act in 2013. When I was in the Senate, we voted to reauthorize the law 98 to 0 and President George W. Bush signed it. But Justice Roberts essentially argued that racism was a thing of the past, and therefore the country no longer needed key protections of the Voting Rights Act. It was one of the worst decisions the court has ever made.",hillary

Via Daily Caller:
The Obama State Department allowed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin to remove call logs, scheduling documents and files described as “Muslim Engagement” from government premises by labeling the records “private,” Judicial Watch has learned.
Judicial Watch obtained records about the document removals in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for all forms authorizing the removal of “personal papers and non-record materials,” according to a Thursday press release.
“These new documents show the Obama State Department had a deal with Hillary Clinton to hide her calls logs and schedules, which would be contrary to FOIA and other laws,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. “When are the American people going to get an honest investigation of the Clinton crimes?”
The documents, which are not classified but carry a special notation that they are not to be made public under normal FOIA procedure, include a list of Clinton’s personal and official calls. The special notation was included as part of an addendum signed by Clarence N. Finney Jr., then-director of the Office of Correspondence and Records, who reviewed the records.",hillary

When Comey was laying out the facts, it sounded like he was laying a factual basis for a criminal charge. And perhaps it was, originally.
Via Fox News:
Newly released documents obtained by Fox News reveal that then-FBI Director James Comey’s draft statement on the Hillary Clinton email probe was edited numerous times before his public announcement, in ways that seemed to water down the bureau’s findings considerably.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, sent a letter to the FBI on Thursday that shows the multiple edits to Comey’s highly scrutinized statement.
In an early draft, Comey said it was “reasonably likely” that “hostile actors” gained access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email account. That was changed later to say the scenario was merely “possible.”
Another edit showed language was changed to describe the actions of Clinton and her colleagues as “extremely careless” as opposed to “grossly negligent.” This is a key legal distinction.
Johnson, writing about his concerns in a letter Thursday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, said the original “could be read as a finding of criminality in Secretary Clinton’s handling of classified material.”

The Human Rights Council has given us a comprehensive framework for addressing this issue on the international level. But at the same time, we each have to work to do more to promote respect for religious differences in our own countries. In the United States, I will admit, there are people who still feel vulnerable or marginalized as a result of their religious beliefs. And we have seen how the incendiary actions of just a very few people, a handful in a country of nearly 300 million, can create wide ripples of intolerance. We also understand that, for 235 years, freedom of expression has been a universal right at the core of our democracy. So we are focused on promoting interfaith education and collaboration, enforcing antidiscrimination laws, protecting the rights of all people to worship as they choose, and to use some old-fashioned techniques of peer pressure and shaming, so that people don’t feel that they have the support to do what we abhor.",hillary
https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/05/02/bad-samaritan-throws-back-to-but-pales-before-the-thrillers-of-the-clinton-era/,“Bad Samaritan” Throws Back to (But Pales Before) the Thrillers of the Clinton Era,"Remember back in the 1990s and early Aughts when James Patterson/John Grisham/Stephen King adaptations littered the movie landscape for as far as the eye could see? Ashley Judd was the land’s reigning warrior princess, stalking serial killers and bringing philandering, fraudster husbands to justice. Those were fun times, when world-class actors were thrown into outrageous melodramatic roles and directors could float implausible conspiracy premises on moody atmospheres and committed performances. (We got so many from Denzel Washington.) But if they got just one element wrong — a cartoonish villain hung out to dry by a bland supporting cast or flat cinematography — that kind of film’s whole mystique just dissipated; we could see that the emperor wore no clothes, and his dialogue was nonsensical. I’m looking at you, Harry Connick Jr., in Copycat, though I appreciate your teaching me about agoraphobia.
Dean Devlin, the director of Geostorm and the co-producer of Independence Day, seems to be attempting to usher in a renaissance of that era. His uneven new thriller, Bad Samaritan — with its title sounding very Grisham — tells the story of a low-level thief who breaks into a fancy-schmancy house and discovers a woman being held captive in a plastic-lined, camera-surveilled room. The homeowner proves to be a psychopath — who is also obsessed with horses. When the thief attempts to bring this criminal to justice, the usual game of cat and mouse ensues. Really, this premise is no more ridiculous than that of Kiss the Girls (1997), Double Jeopardy (1999), Fallen (1998), or The Bone Collector (1999), and acclaimed Scottish actor David Tennant commits to his role as seething, calculating villain Cale Erendreich. But there’s frightfully little atmosphere to this film — anything from creepy sound design to evocative cinematography — rendering the flaws in the story all too visible. (The screenwriter is Brandon Boyce, who’s also responsible for Bryan Singer’s 1998 flop of a Stephen King adaptation, Apt Pupil, which had Ian McKellen playing an aging Nazi in hiding and uttering the befuddling line, “Oh, my dear boy. Don’t you see? We are fucking each other.”)
From the outset, Devlin muddles the basics, like continuity. In the opening scene, when perky Riley (Jacqueline Byers) greets boyfriend Sean (Robert Sheehan) at his door, Riley at first is wearing a full face of makeup and a bra under her shirt, and then suddenly the lipstick is gone, and she takes off her shirt to reveal she’s got nothing on underneath. It’s difficult to get an audience to buy into a suspension of disbelief when the director doesn’t seem to care about the details. Later, Riley is roughed up to the point where I was positive she had to be dead, or at least have suffered a broken neck. The next scene finds her in a hospital bed with perfect eye makeup and a breathing tube down her throat. Despite that tube — usually there for people who are, like, in a coma? — our hero is relatively energetic, lifting herself out of bed to write “Get out” on a notepad and show it to Sean, as though she’ll just have a bruise and be fine in the morning.
While Riley’s character seems to be an afterthought in this story, Cale has been given the weirdest, most elaborate, and unnecessary backstory to justify his madness and violence. I won’t give it away, but suffice to say there is an awkward horse statue jammed into the production design of every room in Cale’s house and cabin. In some ways, Bad Samaritan is like Equus meets Don’t Breathe, but that’s giving it too much credit, considering the relative tameness of its action and dialogue. Devlin could have had Tennant go full Shakespearean malefactor, a fireball of bluster and hysteria, but Cale barely gets to say a word.
My favorite character, the abductee Katie (Kerry Condon), also gets the shaft when it comes to dialogue because for most of the movie, she’s got a horse’s bit wedged into her teeth. When she’s allowed to speak freely, however, Boyce lets loose with the film’s most cutting lines. And though Tennant ditches his Scots dialect and reveals a perfect American accent here, I found it a confusing choice that Devlin would allow the Irishman Sheehan, as Cale’s foil, to keep his accent, while both are supposedly living in Portland, Oregon.
At the very least, Bad Samaritan showcases how much rich assholes have taken over that once working-class city, as Cale and his personality-less huge house seem to fit right in; this picture has all the signs of a movie that got an Oregon tax credit and had to switch locations at the last minute and then somehow accidentally stumbled onto a Portland truth. But if you ever wanted to know what David Tennant would look like with a perm, this movie might be for you.

http://distractify.com/trending/2017/10/24/Z1pO3yS/hillary-trump-tweets,"Hillary Clinton Explains How She Deals With Trump's Tweets, And We're Taking Note","Donald Trump's made himself a lot of enemies over the last few decades of his life, even more so after he became President of the United States. He's currently rocking one of the lowest Presidential approval ratings of all time and it looks like it's not going to get better any time soon.
But if there's one person who's got a sore spot for Trump more than anyone else, it's probably Hillary Clinton.
The former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee knows a thing or two about dealing with Trump and his vitriolic means of self-promotion - she experienced it first hand.
Despite winning the election, bashing Clinton is still a huge part of Trump's political strategy. Hillary bears the brunt of a lot of these online attacks.
Sometimes, she responds.
But on a recent appearance on The Graham Norton show, Hillary revealed yet another strategy she's devised for dealing with Trump.
For the most part: she ignores him and his tweets.
""I ignore a lot of them because there are so may. You could not respond to all of them. But I do respond when I think what he has said is hurtful and unfair, and really causing problems for people.""
The response to Hillary's clapback to Trump's tweet by suggesting he read a children's book was well-received by many and put the brash president in his place.
Some might argue that she ignored a little too much on the election trail and should've shown a heightened level of savagery. Maybe then she would've been in the White House. For now though, we'll have to suffer a little longer while Trump continues to commit embarrassing gaffes such as this.",hillary

Davidson posted his brand new ink on his leg on Instagram with the caption, “Wanted to get @hillaryclinton a Christmas gift so I got a tattoo of my hero. Thanks for being such a badass and one of the strongest people in the universe.”
The tattoo is a classic image of Clinton — complete with power suit and all. The tattoo from Jon Mesa, who also posted it on his Instagram page, received a tidal wave of comments — including a cheeky one from Clinton herself.”
“Thanks, @petedavidson,” said Clinton, who has had her fair share of appearances on SNL. “This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years. But seriously, I’m honored. Merry Christmas my friend.”

http://uproxx.com/news/kellyanne-conway-hillary-clinton-11-year-old-tape/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+uproxx%2Ffeatures+%28UPROXX%29,Kellyanne Conway Slams Hillary Clinton For ‘Spending A Month’ On The 11-Year-Old ‘Access Hollywood’ Tape,"Hillary Clinton finally released a statement Tuesday afternoon five days after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, saying that she was “shocked and appalled by the revelations” and that the “behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated.” Previous to her statement, many had been questioning Clinton’s silence given that Weinstein had contributed to both her and her husband’s presidential campaigns, as well as the Democratic party at large.
Despite having come out against the American film producer, many — especially on the right — are still criticizing her slow response time. After she released her statement, Kellynne Conway tweeted: “It took Hillary abt 5 minutes to blame NRA for madman’s rampage, but 5 days to sorta-kinda blame Harvey Weinstein 4 his sexually assaults [sic].”
On Wednesday morning, Fox News invited Conway to elaborate on her tweet, and the president’s counselor was true to form in slamming Clinton for the discrepancy — taking particular umbrage with the fact that the Clintons have allegedly kept Weinstein’s money. When asked if it would make things right if she returned the donations, the answer from Conway was a resounding “no,” calling the former secretary of state a “hypocrite about women’s empowerment.”
“She spent one solid month, this time last year, talking about an audio tape, from 11 years earlier, where a statement was made by the now President of the United States, who was victorious,” Conway said, smirking, referring to the infamous Access Hollywood tape. “And she didn’t talk to the forgotten man and forgotten woman, she had no optimistic economic plan,” Conway continued, kind of getting off track. “And what has she done privately, in her private life? She’s on a book tour talking about herself and a campaign she lost, she’s not talking about women’s empowerment, she’s not trying to help victims of sexual assault.”
It could be argued that Ms. Clinton is now a private citizen and is free to do whatever she pleases with her life, but that fact is clearly lost on Conway. As is the fact that the sexual assault allegations against Weinstein are every bit as serious as the ones raised at her boss, who as she mentioned, is now President of the United States.",hillary

It certainly has for many women, late night hosts and some men. Even contemporary entertainment powerhouses like Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have come out with stories about Weinstein’s gross alleged behavior. But what about the more powerful among those on the political spectrum — especially those figures who benefited from Weinstein’s financial generosity?
Even President Donald Trump, himself the subject of numerous sexual assault allegations, commented publicly on the accusations against Weinstein. “I’ve known Harvey Weinstein for a long time,” he told reporters. “I’m not at all surprised to see it.” And several Democratic senators have already pledged to donate Weinstein’s previous contributions to women’s organizations.
But what about Trump’s former election rival, Hillary Clinton, or his predecessor, President Barack Obama? Weinstein donated to both of their presidential campaigns, as well as the Democratic Party at-large, and both remained uncharacteristically silent on the matter until Tuesday, when Clinton’s office issued a statement.
“I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,” it read. “The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.” As for Obama and his post-White House team, however, no official statement or comment has yet to be publicized.
Despite Clinton’s brief response to the matter, and the all-too-obvious meanings contained therein, many are questioning why it took her five days to say anything. According to a previous CNN report, “Longtime Hillary Clinton aides have been confused by the former secretary of state’s silence on the issue, questioning — in private — why she has not weighed in at all.” Then again, as numbers obtained by the Center for Responsive Politics make somewhat clear, the $1.5 million Weinstein helped raise for the Clintons between 1990 and 2016 may have influenced the former state secretary’s thinking.

That very large group includes Bourdain’s girlfriend, Asia Argento, and Bourdain hopes that people won’t remain silent on the issue. And since Weinstein has donated to many Democrat candidates (including Hillary Clinton) over the years, the former Democratic nominee’s slow response drew a lot of criticism both for its tardiness and brevity.
On Tuesday, Clinton told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that she was “just sick. I was shocked. I was appalled.” Clinton also said that she “certainly” wasn’t aware of the sexual harassment and only “knew him primarily through politics.”
This response was not adequate enough for Bourdain, who expressed his disappointment in a series of tweets. He called her response “shameful in its deflection and its disingenuousness” and said that he hoped for more from her, given that he believes her to be “one of the most intelligent, well prepared, well briefed politicians ever.”
And I have to say, Hillary's interview with Fareed Zakaria was shameful in its deflection and its disingenuousness.

A post shared by Pete Davidson (@petedavidson) on Dec 15, 2017 at 11:56am PST
Pete Davidson has given Hillary Clinton the sort of Christmas gift she probably wouldn’t think to get herself: A tattoo featuring the likeness of Hillary Clinton.
That smiling ink version of HRC you see in the image above is now permanently on the SNL cast member. (Well, provided this isn’t an elaborate goof or a spoof. Us Weekly spoke to the tat artist who says it’s legit.) Pete’s tattoo features a throwback look for Hillary and isn’t a tattoo of Kate McKinnon as Hillary which is something he can always consider next time.
“Wanted to get @hillaryclinton a Christmas gift so I got a tattoo of my hero,” wrote Davidson in his Instagram photo’s accompanying caption. “Thanks for being such a badass and one of the strongest people in the universe.”
The 2016 presidential candidate seems pretty happy with her gift. She responded in the comments and says she’s honored by the tribute.
“Thanks, @petedavidson, This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years,” she wrote. “But seriously, I’m honored. Merry Christmas my friend.”
The tattoo hasn’t gotten universal love in the comment section, though. At the moment, the bulk of comments coming his way are MAGA proclamations and folks still clinging to the disproven PizzaGate conspiracy. Considering how Pete Davidson interacts with that crowd, it’s hard to imagine he’ll be too worried about the lack of approval.",hillary

Bush and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton are raising money for their preferred candidates in the closely watched Virginia governor’s race.
Clinton will be the featured guest at a fundraiser for Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam in New York on Oct. 4, while Bush is slated to headline a fundraiser for Republican Ed Gillespie on Oct. 16 in Alexandria.
Gillespie was a senior White House adviser during Bush’s presidency. Bush has given $50,000 to Gillespie’s campaign and political action committee.
Northam is facing Gillespie in one of only two off-year gubernatorial contests in November. The swing state contest is viewed as a possible early referendum on President Donald Trump’s first year in office and a preview of the 2018 midterm elections.

http://washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/14/craig-murray-says-source-of-hillary-clinton-campai/,WikiLeaks figure says ‘disgusted’ Democrat leaked Clinton campaign emails,"A WikiLeaks figure is claiming that he received leaked Clinton campaign emails from a “disgusted” Democratic whistleblower, while the White House continued to blame Russian hackers Wednesday for meddling in the presidential election and asserted that Donald Trump was “obviously aware” of Moscow’s efforts on his behalf.
Craig Murray, a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close associate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, said in the report by the Daily Mail that he flew to Washington for a clandestine handoff with one of the email sources in September.
He said he received a package in a wooded area near American University.
“Neither of [the leaks] came from the Russians,” Mr. Murray told the British newspaper. “The source had legal access to the information. The documents came from inside leaks, not hacks.”
WikiLeaks published thousands of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, providing a steady stream of negative news coverage of the Democratic presidential nominee during the final weeks of the campaign. Mr. Murray said the leakers were motivated by “disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders.”
The Daily Mail report noted that Mr. Murray was removed from his diplomatic post amid allegations of misconduct.
The White House said Wednesday that Mr. Trump was “obviously aware” of Russian hacking to benefit his presidential campaign and suggested that the administration didn’t retaliate against Moscow because the U.S. has more to lose than Russia does in an all-out cyberwar.
Referring to Mr. Trump’s offhand snark last summer that Moscow might be able to locate missing emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the Republican might have viewed Russia’s cyberattacks as helpful to his presidential campaign.
“There was ample evidence that was known long before the election, and in most cases long before October, about the Trump campaign in Russia, everything from the Republican nominee himself calling on Russia to hack his opponent,” Mr. Earnest said. “It might be an indication that he was obviously aware and concluded, based on whatever facts or sources he had available to him, that Russia was involved and their involvement was having a negative impact on his opponent’s campaign.”
Mr. Trump has openly rejected the idea that Russia was behind the attacks or that the cyberintrusions were intended to help him win the election.
He also accused the administration and liberal news outlets of trying to delegitimize his election. There is no evidence that the election process was hacked, by the Russians or anyone else.
Meanwhile on Wednesday, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had to cancel a closed-door classified briefing on the issue of suspected Russian interference after U.S. intelligence agencies refused to cooperate.
Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and committee chairman, requested that the FBI, CIA, Office of the Director of National Intelligence and National Security Agency provide witnesses, in part in response to reports last week in The Washington Post and The New York Times that intelligence agencies think the Kremlin deliberately tried to push the election to Mr. Trump, something not supported by postelection testimony to the panel.
But according to Fox News, “agencies refused to provide representatives for the session.”
“It is unacceptable that the Intelligence Community directors would not fulfill the House Intelligence Committee’s request to be briefed tomorrow on the cyber-attacks that occurred during the presidential campaign,” Mr. Nunes said in a statement. “The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes.”
Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, accused people within intelligence agencies of trying to undermine the U.S. election results to curry favor with liberal media and are now ducking accountability.
“We should all be very concerned about that,” she said in an appearance on Fox News Channel.
The Democratic National Committee, essentially an arm of the Obama White House, compounded the friction Wednesday by accusing Mr. Trump of giving Russia “an early holiday gift that smells like a payoff” with the nomination of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state. The DNC warned that Mr. Tillerson would be too cozy in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“It’s rather easy to connect the dots,” the DNC said. “Russia meddled in the U.S. election in order to benefit Trump, and now he’s repaying Vladimir Putin by nominating Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.”
It was the latest broadside by the White House and its allies against the president-elect in an increasingly tense transition debate over the impact of the cyberintrusions, which mainly targeted Democrats such as Mr. Podesta.
Departing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, compared the alleged Russian hacking to terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on U.S. soil. “I think this is as big a deal as Watergate, as 9/11,” he said.
Democrats in hindsight have accused the administration of failing to warn the public about Russia’s alleged hacking as early as May, when private assessments pinned the blame on Moscow. In October, the administration released a statement from Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper that identified Russia as the culprit.
The White House said Mr. Obama waited until October, just weeks before the election, to raise concerns about Russia’s involvement because he didn’t want to appear to be playing politics with the issue.
“It would have been inappropriate for White House figures, including the president of the United States, to be rushing the intelligence community to expedite their analysis of this situation, because we were concerned about the negative impact it was having on the president’s preferred candidate in the presidential election,” Mr. Earnest said.
The president’s spokesman also said the administration tried to get bipartisan cooperation from Congress this fall to warn state election officials about Russian interference, but top Republicans balked.
“Leader [Mitch] McConnell and Speaker [Paul D.] Ryan did not readily agree to it,” Mr. Earnest said. “We didn’t get the kind of prompt cooperation we would have liked.”
The administration eventually did issue warnings to state election officials and said there was no evidence of Russian interference via the internet on Election Day.
The White House still won’t say whether the U.S. has retaliated against what it describes as Russian efforts to influence the election of Donald Trump. “It merits a proportional response. I am not in a position to confirm whether we have initiated it or not,” Mr. Earnest said.
He said “the United States is particularly vulnerable” to cyberattacks because of its heavy reliance on the internet.
“Given the interconnected nature of our society and our economy, the United States is in a unique position, vis-a-vis the rest of the world, because we rely on 21st-century communications technology for just about everything, in a way that lots of other societies and economies and countries don’t,” he said.",hillary
http://washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/10/hillary-clinton-breaks-president-obamas-2012-spend/,Clinton spends twice as much as Trump in losing presidential bid,"He may be a billionaire, but President-elect Donald Trump showed during the presidential race that he knows how to stretch a buck.
The Republican candidate and his backers spent only half that of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her supporters on the way to his Nov. 8 victory, according to media reports on campaign spending released Friday.
The Clinton campaign, Democratic Party and pro-Clinton expenditure committees and PACs spent a record $1.2 billion, twice as much as the $600 million laid out by the Trump camp, Republicans and pro-Trump groups, the New York Post reported.
The latest Federal Election Commission figures back Mr. Trump’s assertion six months ago that there was no need for him to amass at least $1 billion to run a successful race against the former Secretary of State, given the former reality television star’s ability to draw free media.
“There’s no reason to raise that,” Mr. Trump told Bloomberg in June. “I just don’t think I need nearly as much money as other people need because I get so much publicity. I get so many invitations to be on television. I get so many interviews, if I want them.”
Mr. Trump estimated at one point that he would need to spend $100 million of his own money, but wound up contributing $66 million, about a third less than anticipated.
While both campaigns went on a spending spree in the final stretch, Mrs. Clinton was left with only $839,000 on hand by the end of the election, while Mr. Trump still had $7.6 million.
Mrs. Clinton wound up blowing past the spending record set in 2012 by President Obama, whose campaign and Democrat committees spent $1.12 billion, slightly more than the $1.02 billion spent by Republican Mitt Romney and GOP groups.
The Trump campaign committee alone spent $328.4 million through late November as opposed to $563.9 million by the Clinton camp, according to the FEC.
In other words, Mr. Trump’s 306 electoral votes cost about $1.05 million a piece, while each of Mrs. Clinton’s 232 electoral votes cost $2.43 million, an NBC News analysis found.
Republican candidates for federal office in general got more bang for their buck than did Democrats. Republicans spent $633.1 million to the Democrats’ $799.5 million.",hillary
http://washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/10/glenn-simpsons-fusion-gps-ran-donald-trump-smear-c/,Fusion GPS tried to tie Trump to Clinton’s pedophile pal Epstein as part of smear campaign,"Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm whose Democrat-financed Russia dossier fueled an FBI investigation into Donald Trump, pitched other stories about the Republican presidential candidate to Washington reporters, including an attempt to tie him to a convicted pedophile who was once buddies with former President Bill Clinton.
Journalist sources told The Washington Times that Fusion founder Glenn Simpson pushed the idea of a close relationship between Mr. Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting sex from an underage girl.
The Trump-Epstein link appears purely social, far short of Mr. Clinton’s 20-plus plane rides on Epstein’s “Lolita Express” private jet around the globe in the early 2000s.
Ken Silverstein, the reporter who ultimately wrote an Epstein-Trump report, confirmed to The Times that Fusion had sourced the story. Mr. Silverstein, founder and editor of WashingtonBabylon.com who wrote the story for Vice.com, defended Mr. Simpson as a solid source of information that must first be confirmed.
For years, Fusion GPS has been an influential hidden hand in Washington, with entree into the city’s most powerful news bureaus.
Behind the scenes, the private intelligence firm run by former Wall Street Journal reporters was particularly active last year working to defeat Mr. Trump. Fusion leader Mr. Simpson, who railed against sleazy opposition research as a reporter, harbored a strong desire to bring down the builder of hotels with, well, opposition research.
Fusion representatives met with New York Times reporters during the Democratic National Convention in July 2016.
Ironically, it appears The Times was the first to out Fusion on Jan. 11 as the source of the scandalous dossier that BuzzFeed posted the previous day. BuzzFeed did the posting without identifying Fusion or dossier writer Christopher Steele, a former British spy.
“The New York Times, I know they work with Fusion,” said Mr. Silverstein, an investigative reporter who skewers the left and right. “Fusion works with a lot of big media organizations. That would give them influence in Washington.”
“I have worked with them,” he said. “I have gotten tips from them and stories from them. And every time I do, I go out and re-report … because I assume it is for a client and it is not 100 percent accurate. And I’ve never gotten anything from them that was 100 percent accurate. Not because they were slanting or lying or twisting. Every time I’ve gotten something from them, ‘This is a report. You’ve got to check it out.’ I have a great relationship with those guys.”
During summer 2016, Fusion’s juicy tidbits enticed a number of elite journalists to heed Mr. Simpson’s call to meet Mr. Steele in person.
By then, Fusion had amassed a deep database on Mr. Trump, his contacts, his holdings and his deals.
“Fusion has filed a ton of [Freedom of Information Act] requests on Trump, especially in New York,” said the journalist source who asked not to be named and has had contact with the firm.
A Washington Times inquiry found that Mr. Simpson and crew were dishing out other supposed dirt on Mr. Trump and friends not contained in the 35-page dossier. Some of those tips have proved to be as shaky as Mr. Steele’s election collusion charges.
Besides the Jeffrey Epstein dump, Fusion pushed the story that a special email server existed between Trump Tower and Moscow’s Alfa bank, the journalist source said. The report has failed to catch on. Internet sleuths traced the IP address to a marketing spam server located outside Philadelphia.
Pre-dossier, readers rarely had seen Fusion’s hand in sourcing stories even though it may have instigated and framed scores of them over the years.
Today, Fusion’s cover has been blown. It feels the sting of unwanted publicity in both the liberal and conservative press and intense scrutiny from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Senate and House committees demanded that Fusion produce representatives for hours of closed-door testimony.
Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, signed subpoenas forcing Fusion to disclose who pays it and whom it pays. His probe unmasked the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party as dossier financiers.
Why such intense intrusion into a secretive opposition research firm?
The unmasking agent was Fusion’s own product: Mr. Steele’s dossier. It has proved to be so unfounded on its core collusion charges yet so influential in prompting investigations of the president that Republicans demanded to know its roots.
Those roots are: After Democrats paid Fusion through a middleman law firm, Mr. Simpson in June 2016 hired Mr. Steele with Clinton campaign cash. Mr. Steele in turn handed out money to unidentified Kremlin operatives who sullied Mr. Trump and associates.
As Mr. Steele churned out dossier chapters during the summer campaign, Mr. Simpson peddled them to Washington’s mightiest journalists.
Mr. Steele wrote in July, the month he briefed the FBI and it began its probe, of an “extensive conspiracy between Trump’s campaign team and the Kremlin.”
After the BuzzFeed posting, The New York Times outed the dossier duo of Fusion and Mr. Steele.
Democrats began to cite the dossier’s unconfirmed Trump charges at hearings and on TV.
As the charges remained unconfirmed into the spring, Republicans started focusing attention on a firm whose livelihood relies on a cloak of confidentiality.
Republicans, including Mr. Nunes and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa have been conducting investigations into how the dossier influenced the FBI to start one of the most important criminal investigations in U.S. history.
As Fusion fends off pursuers and gets ensnared in libel lawsuits against Mr. Steele and BuzzFeed, its costs are mounting.
Three Russian businessmen-bankers are suing Fusion for libel, creating a second legal front. Fusion is paying at least two law firms to fend off Mr. Nunes’ incursion in U.S. District Court.
“They’re under the weather because of their legal bills,” the journalist source said.
Part of Fusion’s defense is that it enjoys First Amendment rights just like its founders’ days at The Wall Street Journal.
Fusion jealously guards the list of its journalistic recipients and, in turn, is treated as a confidential source to the point that there are rarely Simpson fingerprints on its investigative products.
But the dossier’s disclosure broke the code of silence. In one of three libel lawsuits, Mr. Steele has been forced to explain how he and Fusion worked together.
In a court filing in London, he named names: In Washington in September, Mr. Steele met with The New York Times, The Washington Post, Yahoo News, The New Yorker and CNN — a who’s who of America’s liberal media establishment.
The next month, Mr. Steele said, he delivered a second briefing to The New York Times, The Washington Post and Yahoo News.
Before Mr. Steele’s D.C. visit, Fusion turned to old colleagues at The Wall Street Journal. In July, a reporter contacted Carter Page, a Trump campaign volunteer. Mr. Steele had spun a web of deceit and lawbreaking by Mr. Page on a trip he took to Moscow to deliver a public speech at a university.
The call blindsided Mr. Page, a New York energy investor who had no idea a dossier time bomb lay ready to destroy his life. The call also showed that Fusion can summon the top of Washington’s journalism food chain to run down its tips.
The Wall Street Journal did not run a story at that time. Mr. Page, who lived in Moscow in the 2000s and knows scores of Russians, said the dossier sections on him are fabrications.
Mr. Steele said he warned journalists that they must confirm his intelligence before reporting. Mr. Steele “understood that the information provided might be used for the purpose of further research, but would not be published or attributed,” his attorneys said.
Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff wrote of the charges against Mr. Page, attributing them not to the dossier but to a Western intelligence source. The story blazed across the internet and became red meat for Clinton campaign surrogates.
On Oct. 31, 2016, a second dossier story appeared, this one by David Corn in the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones. He is also a co-author with Mr. Isikoff of “Hubris,” a book on the Iraq War that is critical of former President George W. Bush.
Mr. Corn conducted perhaps the only published interview with Mr. Steele during the election campaign, though he hid the ex-spy’s identity as a “former senior intelligence officer.” The story refers to Fusion but not by name.
Mr. Steele’s quotes conveyed an energized source as he bragged about his ability to get the FBI to accept his memos beginning in early July and then starting an investigation into the Trump campaign.
The FBI has refused to publicly answer dossier questions. The Mother Jones story is among the best-known evidence that the bureau began investigating the Trump campaign based on a Democratic Party-financed scandal sheet that remains unconfirmed.
In January 2016, as candidate Trump scrambled to stitch together a presidential campaign against 16 Republican opponents, Vice.com ran a story on his ties to Epstein, the billionaire sex offender who owns a Caribbean island called Little St. James.
Reporters have confirmed Mr. Clinton’s visits to the island aboard Epstein’s “Lolita Expres,” based on court records.
Mr. Trump’s ties to the fellow Florida billionaire appear to be more social — some dinner parties, two plane trips, and hanging out at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
A woman filed a lawsuit saying Mr. Trump raped her when she was a teenage acquaintance of Epstein’s. “Jane Doe” dropped her lawsuit a few days before the election. Mr. Trump’s people vigorously denied the whole scenario.
Mr. Silverstein, who wrote the Vice.Com story, was asked by The Washington Times if Fusion pushed the Epstein-Trump story.
“Since you asked, yes, they helped me with that,” Mr. Silverstein said. “But as you can see, I could not make a strong case for Trump being super close to Epstein, so they could hardly have been thrilled with that story. [In my humble opinion], that was the best story written about Trump’s ties to Epstein, but I failed to nail him. Trump’s ties were mild compared to Bill Clinton‘s.
“I said Fusion could not have been happy with the Epstein story,” he added. “What I mean is that I never proved a really sleazy connection, so frankly I was disappointed too, I thought there was more (and still wonder). But Fusion never pressured me to write anything untrue, and they never told me anything about ties between DT and JE that was false. That’s important. Their work has been solid if not 100 percent accurate in their reports, just as I periodically make mistakes. I have never seen malice or anything less than the best effort to be accurate.”
The fact-checking system also applies to the dossier.
“I don’t think anyone really nailed them because I don’t think they did anything wrong,” Mr. Silverstein said. “I think they were chasing money like all these firms do. Maybe they were chasing too hard. But I haven’t seen them breaking the law. … The reporters have to vet it and verify it. … A private intelligence firm working for a private client, you can’t assume you are getting something that is 100 percent accurate.”
Mr. Silverstein takes delight in taking the left and right to task.
In a Dec. 8 story in WashingtonBablyon.com, he wrote of the latest CNN goof: “Well, well, well. A central ‘fact’ of the whole Russia-Trump collusion story turns out to be fake news. The original ‘fact’ was reported by CNN, President Donald Trump’s favorite Fake News Network, so Trump is going to be popping corks on champagne bottles this weekend. Nice job, CNN!”
Romney and VanderSloot
Until the dossier’s splash, Fusion’s secrecy tradecraft was nearly watertight. Its sparse web home page is mostly white space around a two-paragraph mission statement and an “info” email address.
But a few leaks have happened, such as its investigations — some would say hit jobs — of big donors to Republican Mitt Romney in his 2012 bid to unseat President Obama.
The Obama campaign listed eight megadonors as bad people. One of them, Idaho businessman Frank VanderSloot, donated $1 million to a pro-Romney PAC.
The Wall Street Journal editorial page reported during the election that someone was rummaging through Mr. VanderSloot’s divorce files. The paper traced the operative to Fusion GPS. Mr. Simpson defended the dirt-gathering on grounds that Mr. VanderSloot’s wife contributed to a campaign against same-sex marriage.
Then there is Fusion’s own Russia connection. While Fusion is exposing supposed collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, its operatives have been working for Russians to dishonor Bill Browder, a prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin.
The web of connections is complex: Russian money is funding Fusion to destroy the reputation of Mr. Browder, a U.S.-British banker, for his work to persuade Congress to enact the 2012 Magnitsky Act. The act is a sanctions law against Moscow, and the Putin regime wants it repealed. Mr. Browder told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Fusion received Russian money via the law firm BakerHostetler to launch “a smear campaign against me.”
In another case, Fusion allowed Planned Parenthood to identify it as the firm that analyzed hours of secret video taken by the pro-life group Center for Medical Progress. The group said it captured Planned Parenthood leaders talking about selling fetal body parts.
Fusion issued a report saying the videos were not accurate. The pro-life group’s own analysis showed no manipulation.
The irony in all this is that Mr. Simpson once condemned smutty opposition research as a scourge on the body politic.
He co-wrote a 1996 book, “Dirty Little Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics,” with celebrity University of Virginia politics professor Larry J. Sabato.
“Most opposition researchers claim to pay attention mostly to legislative votes and floor statements to see if their opponent’s words jibe with his or her record,” Mr. Simpson and Mr. Sabato said in quotes unearthed by RealClear Investigations. “Without question, many abide strictly by this unwritten code. Yet many of their brethren also examine highly personal information, with the result that issues often surface that are only marginally related, or even completely unrelated, to the office being contested.”
In an interview with C-SPAN’s Brian Lamb, Mr. Simpson bemoaned the use of “push polls” to spread unfounded rumors about candidates.
The “highly personal information” Mr. Simpson condemned 21 years ago certainly can be found in the salacious Trump dossier or his promotion of a Trump-Epstein alliance.
In a sense, the dossier was a failure in that Mr. Simpson could not persuade a large number of reporters to spread its smut during the election campaign. The dossier’s 35 pages ultimately subjected Fusion to an unwanted limelight, a congressional investigation and steep legal fees.
In January, The New York Times described the failure to confirm the dossier’s charges before Nov. 8.
“Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele shared the memos first with their clients, and later with the FBI and multiple journalists at The New York Times and elsewhere. … Many reporters from multiple news organizations tried to verify the claims in the memos but were unsuccessful.”
But in another sense, the dossier — with all its unproven and far-fetched tales — has been a political success for Trump haters.
It influenced the FBI to launch a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign that has grown into a full-blown special counsel inquiry with nearly 20 prosecutors and scores of FBI agents.
The dossier created thousands of social media devotees who are convinced its felony charges against the president and his aides are true.
Back in London, Mr. Steele can take pleasure in a special counsel investigation that could dog the Trump White House, the president, and current and former aides for months, maybe years.",hillary
http://washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/18/russia-tables-turn-roping-clinton-obama-holder-not/,"Russia tables turn, roping Clinton, Obama, Holder, not Trump","ANALYSIS/OPINION:
The tables have turned and what was once the media’s favorite message — President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to steal the election — has now grown silent.
Apparently, it’s Bill and Hillary Clinton who’ve been doing the behind-scenes and suspicious dealings with Russia all along. Oh, and perhaps others in the Barack Obama administration, too.
You think special counsel Robert Mueller might switch the target of his investigation any time soon? Seems a bit time-wasting — not to mention taxpayer dollar-wasting — to keep on the Trump trail, desperately searching for signs of a collusion that just didn’t happen.
Futile is a word that comes to mind.
Better to dig deeper into this, as reported by The Hill: “Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States.”
Intercepted emails shows that Russia had actually gained an inroad in America and compromised a U.S. uranium trucking firm with bribes.
But this is the bigger news: The feds also found an eyewitness who provided documented evidence to show that these Russia nuke officials had sent millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation — at a time when Hillary was serving as secretary of state and on a government body that extended favor to Russia.
Of course, this isn’t exactly new.
Way back in April of 2015, The New York Times ran this headline: “Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal.” And among its many, many lines was this one: “As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation.”
In fact, that “flow of cash” was actually four separate flows of cash, for a total amount of $2.35 million. And, we also learned from this New York Times piece, “those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons.”
A lot of this was also uncovered a outlined by other writers, as well — John Rappoport, investigative journalist, comes to mind, as well as Peter Schweitzer, of “Clinton Cash” author fame.
But what is coming to light is what others knew, and when.
The feds suspected as early as 2009 that Russia was engaged in this dirty dealing. And the United States, under Barack Obama’s administration, did nothing.
“Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting [Vladimir] Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions,” The Hill wrote.
The American people want to know — was U.S. security compromised by the Obama-Clinton deals with Russia?
Mueller’s tasked with the wrong job. If he really wants to find out if America’s interests were compromised in any way by Russia, he needs to quit looking Trump’s way and start digging deep into the Clintons and yes, the Obama administration.
The Hill asked both Clinton and then-attorney general Eric Holder for comment. Curiously, neither had anything to say at this time. Their silence is both telling, and unacceptable. Now if only the same leftists who’ve been clamoring for impeachment of Trump over supposed collusion with Russia would similarly demand answers about Clinton, Holder and Obama — maybe we’d get to the finally get to the bottom of this.",hillary

The failed Democratic presidential nominee said she was “honored” by the gesture after Mr. Davidson posted a photo of his new ink on Instagram over the weekend.
“Thanks, @petedavidson. This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years,” Mrs. Clinton joked on Mr. Davidson’s Instagram post. “But seriously, I’m honored. Merry Christmas my friend.”
The tattoo appears to be of a younger Mrs. Clinton with shoulder-length hair and wearing one of her signature suit blazers.
“Wanted to get @hillaryclinton a Christmas gift so I got a tattoo of my hero,” Mr. Davidson, 24, wrote Saturday. “Thanks for being such a badass and one of the strongest people in the universe 💙 Tatt by @jonmesa.”
Mr. Mesa, the tattoo artist credited with the work, posted a photo of the same tattoo Friday night on his own Instagram account.
A phone call by The Washington Post to No Idols Tattoo in New York City, where Mr. Mesa works, confirmed that the tattoo is real.
“[Mrs. Clinton] saw Pete’s Instagram post on a flight back from L.A. to New York and replied from her account,” Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told The Post in an email, adding that the former secretary of state was joking when she said she had a tattoo of Mr. Davidson.
Mr. Davidson made headlines earlier this year when he revealed that he quit drugs and alcohol and was sober for the first time in eight years. He routinely mocks President Trump, Mrs. Clinton’s former rival, on “SNL’s” “Weekend Update.”",hillary
http://washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/15/donald-trump-says-fbi-documents-prove-bias-against,"Trump says FBI documents prove bias against him, favoritism for Clinton","Responding to revelations that a top FBI official in the Russia investigation showed bias against him in text messages, President Trump said Friday that the episode was “disgraceful” and that he will reform the law-enforcement agency to be “bigger and better than ever.”
“It is very sad when you look at those documents, how they’ve done that is really, really disgraceful,” Mr. Trump told reporters on his way to an FBI academy graduation. “You have a lot of very angry people that are seeing it.”
FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a key role in the Hillary Clinton email probe, was reassigned from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation after officials found texts messages from him expressing support for Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 campaign and disparaging Mr. Trump.
Mr. Strzok had a big part in changing former FBI Director James B. Comey’s early draft language about Mrs. Clinton’s actions with her private email server from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.” He also conducted the FBI’s interview of Mrs. Clinton.
The president said the revelations prove his assertions that the FBI treated Mrs. Clinton too lightly.
“When you look at the Hillary Clinton investigation, I’ve been saying it for a long time, that was rigged system, folks,” Mr. Trump said. “It was rigged.”
As far as the multiple investigations into the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Moscow, the president said “there is absolutely no collusion, that has been proven.”
“Even the Democrats admit there is no collusion,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re spending millions and millions of dollars. There is absolutely no collusion. I didn’t make a phone call to Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. Everybody knows it. That was a Democrat hoax. It was an excuse for losing the election. It should have never been this way, where they spend all these millions of dollars. We’ve got to get back to running the country.”
Asked if he would pardon former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty two weeks ago to lying to the FBI in the Russia probe, the president replied, “I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet. We’ll see what happens. I can say this, when you look at what’s going on at the FBI and with the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.”",hillary
http://washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/21/20-years-ago-bill-clinton-signed-defense-of-marria/,"20 years ago, Bill Clinton signed Defense of Marriage Act","Today is the 20th anniversary of Bill Clinton signing DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.
(AP) On Sept. 21, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal recognition of same-sex marriages a day after saying the law should not be used as an excuse for discrimination, violence or intimidation against gays and lesbians. (Although never formally repealed, DoMA was effectively overturned by U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 2013 and 2015.)
And Clinton was not some lone-renegade Democrat either. Here’s a full list of Democrats who signed DOMA (a list that includes Sen. Harry Reid and current VP Joe Biden).
A very reasonable question to ask: What changed since 1996?
What changed beyond the politics? Or beyond the culture and pop-culture movement on the issue. Those arenas of thought change like current fashion.
Have you seen what the campaign website for Hillary Clinton says about DOMA? Reading it, you might think DOMA was foisted on the nation entirely by the opposition party, not a bipartisan effort. Take a look:
The Problem
Prior to a June 2013 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) singled out lawfully married same-sex couples for unequal treatment under federal law. This law discriminated in two important ways. First, Section 2 of DOMA purports to allow states to refuse to recognize valid civil marriages of same-sex couples. Second, Section 3 of the law carves all same-sex couples, regardless of their marital status, out of all federal statutes, regulations and rulings applicable to all other married people—thereby denying them over 1,100 federal benefits and protections.
Fortunately, the Court held Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States (2013). Two years later, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court ruled that bans on marriage equality are unconstitutional. This ruling supersedes Section 2 of DOMA and therefore leaves it unenforceable. However, DOMA’s discriminatory language still remains part of the U.S. Code, even though it is unenforceable.
If DOMA was all that badness wrapped up into one piece of Democratically-endorsed and Democratically signed legislation, then why did all those Ivy-League trained lawyers support it? Starting with the two brilliant legal minds who then occupied the White House?
I realize that the Clintons now claim that they supported DOMA as a mechanism for stopping a Constitutional Amendment against same-sex marriage. But even gay activists refute that rewriting of history.
It’s not that a politician can never change a belief or come to a different understanding on an issue.
But do we really believe that the Clintons were for DOMA? No.
Do we have any evidence that the Clintons were against DOMA? No.
Whatever you think of DOMA, who can respect, or trust, such trickiness on such an important issue of our times?",hillary

Nearly thirty years after credible and even verified reports of grand Democrat poobah Bill Clinton molesting women and so much worse, Mrs. Gillibrand has finally decided the monster should have been thrown out of the White House for his lecherous assaults.
“Yes, I think that is the appropriate response,” she said when pressed about whether Mr. Clinton should have been hounded from office.
In other words, Ken Starr and the Republicans of the 1990s were exactly right.
Then Mrs. Gillibrand offered a truly astonishing defense of the most famous rapist in American politics.
“Things have changed today, and I think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction.”
In other words, that’s just how men behaved back then. It was just a different time.
Yeah, that may excuse Mr. Clinton’s tight running shorts and public scarfing of McDonald’s Happy Meals while wearing those tight running shorts. But “times have changed” does not excuse rape.
Rape is wrong today, and it was wrong back then. Molesting an intern in the White House is wrong today, and it was wrong 20 years ago.
Just as it was wrong 50 years ago for a president to force a young staffer to perform oral sex on a colleague in the White House swimming pool while the president gazed on.
Hiding behind such revisionist history is the gutless folly of partisans who care only about political power and nothing about human decency, justice or the rights of women.
Consider the moment that Mrs. Gillibrand has so bravely come forward to take this principled stance against Bill Clinton.
Bubba has been put out to pasture to stare into the distance with a vacant smile and chew on his tongue. Hillary Clinton’s political career is finished. For the first time in 30 years, Democrats are abandoning the Rat Ship Clinton.
In other words, Mrs. Gillibrand finally arrives on the battlefield to unsheathe her weapon. She is walking around shooting the wounded — actually, she’s shooting the dead. And now she wants to be decorated as a war hero.
The Clintons were quick to dispatch a gangster hit man to remind Mrs. Gillibrand she still owed them.
“Over 20 yrs you took the Clintons’ endorsements, money, and seat. Hypocrite,” Philippe Reines said in a Twitter shiv.
Indeed, Mrs. Gillibrand is a woman who spent her whole national political career drafting behind Mrs. Clinton, whose own career was entirely manufactured by the rapist himself.
Accusers must be believed, Mrs. Gillibrand and other Clintonista Democrats are fond of saying. It is the Clinton way.
Mrs. Clinton, after all, believed every one of her husband’s accusers. And then hunted them down to smear and destroy each and every one of them until not a peep could be heard from them above the baying of the media mob determined to help carry out the Clintons’ dirty work.
Amazingly, some of the Clinton accusers — owing to their own amazing strength, as well as the timeless veracity of their claims — endured and still today can recount the gropes, slurps and rapes from the man who led the Democratic Party for so long.
What is breathtaking is how partisan and politically transactional Democrats are when it comes to harassing, molesting and raping girls, interns and women. If it’s someone on their team wearing one of their jerseys, it’s just crazy Uncle Joe or randy Bubba.
It is how you wind up with people like Sen. Al Franken, the television comedian who prefers his prey asleep.
Or Harvey Weinstein, who is basically responsible for everything filthy, dehumanizing and degrading that has come out of Hollywood the past quarter century since “Reservoir Dogs.”
Or child rapist Kevin Spacey, who is one of those rare figures idolized in both Washington and Hollywood, celebrated for his cynical, conniving, power-grabbing character on television.
And, of course, ex-congressman Anthony Weiner, a top lieutenant in the Clinton mafia who just last week went off to prison for sex stalking an underage girl over the internet.

“I was appalled,” Clinton said of the accusations. “It was something that was just intolerable in every way. And, you know, like so many people who’ve come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past.”
Speaking to Fareed Zakaria as part of her current book tour, the former Democratic presidential nominee acknowledged she “probably would have” called Weinstein a friend prior to hearing about his alleged misconduct.
“People in Democratic politics for a couple of decades appreciated his help and support,” she said. “And I think these stories coming to light now — and people who never spoke out before having the courage to speak out — just clearly demonstrates that this behavior that he engaged in cannot be tolerated.”
Regarding Weinstein’s donations, Clinton said it wasn’t possible to return the money but she would give it to charity.
“What other people are saying, what my former colleagues are saying, is they’re going to donate it to charity, and of course I will do that,” she said. “I give 10 percent of my income to charity every year, this will be part of that. There’s no — there’s no doubt about it.”

On the heels of blistering reports by The New Yorker and The New York Times with numerous actresses coming forward with reports of harassment and assault, the former Democratic presidential nominee released this statement via her communications director:
Weinstein was fired two days ago by the board of directors of The Weinstein Company after an initial round of reports accused him of harassment. New reports have been published Tuesday against Weinstein containing on-the-record allegations from stars such as Angelina Jolie, Gwenyth Paltrow, Rosanna Arquette, Mira Sorvino, and several others. Actress Asia Argento claimed Weinstein raped her by forcibly performing oral sex on her, one of three women to allege assault in the New Yorker story.
In a statement provided to the New Yorker, Weinstein denied the claims. “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,” a representative for Weinstein said. “Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”
Weinstein is a longtime supporter of Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill, and hosted a series of fundraisers for Clinton and former president Barack Obama over the years, along with contributing to many other Democratic candidates. Former First Lady Michelle Obama once said of Weinstein, “I want to start by thanking Harvey Weinstein for organizing this amazing day. Harvey. This is possible because of Harvey. He is a wonderful human being, a good friend and just a powerhouse.”
In the wake of the initial reports against Weinstein, numerous elected officials from the Democratic party donated contributions Weinstein made to their campaigns and offices in the past.",hillary

https://www.elitedaily.com/p/can-hillary-clinton-replace-eric-schneiderman-heres-how-interim-ag-is-chosen-9017274,Can Hillary Clinton Replace Eric Schneiderman? Here's How An Interim AG Is Chosen,"On Monday, May 7, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was at the center of a bombshell report that featured four women alleging habitual physical and psychological abuse. Shortly after the report's publication, Schneiderman was attorney general no more, with the 63-year-old resigning from his post on Monday night. Now, among other important questions the resignation has raised, is who will become the new attorney general, and many people are wondering if Hillary Clinton will replace Eric Schneiderman, or if it will be another prominent New York politician.
In a statement provided to The New Yorker, which first reported on the allegations against the attorney general, Schneiderman said, ""In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.""
As for who will replace Schneiderman as attorney general, the answer will be decided by the state's legislature.
New York law dictates that both houses of the legislature — the state senate and the state assembly — are responsible for holding a joint session to vote for an interim attorney general in the event of a resignation. The interim AG then holds the office for the remainder of the original AG's term.
In this case, Schneiderman's term is set to conclude at the end of 2018. The election for a new attorney general — which Schneiderman was set to contest — will be held in November. Two months prior, in September, the primary to decide the Democratic nominee for the race will be held.
Before Schneiderman's resignation, that primary looked to be all but a formality,as no major democratic figures planned to run against him. Now, however, it's anybody's guess as to who will be selected by the state's legislature, and, subsequently, who will win the Democratic primary. On the other side of the aisle, corporate lawyer Manny Alicandro is running for attorney general as a Republican, according to Manhattan-based TV station NY 1.
In the meantime, New York's state solicitor general Barbara Underwood will become the acting attorney general, according to the New York Daily News, as others speculate who could be the next permanent AG.
On Monday night, Hillary Clinton's name was brought up, specifically by the likes of Esquire columnist Charles Pierce and Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs, the latter regarding a Hillary-for-AG shout as a ""hot take."" Clinton is, of course, a Yale Law graduate, an esteemed New York state politician, and the former Secretary of State.
Then there were others, like CNN's Jeff Toobin, who raised the possibility of Preet Bharara seeking the position. Bharara is a former US attorney for the southern district of New York. He was fired by President Donald Trump in March 2017 after he refused to resign. His resignation was requested by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Since his firing, Bharara has maintained visibility as a constant critic of the Trump administration.

The allegations of abuse against now-former New York Attorney General Schneiderman were reported for The New Yorker by Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow.Farrow also reported bombshell pieces for The New Yorker about disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein for the same magazine, while Mayer has been an investigative reporter for the magazine for over two decades.
The sources for the allegations were four women whom Schneiderman — who had been New York's attorney general since 2010 — reportedly dated within the last five years. All four allege that he slapped them across the face. Some of the stories more specifically allege that Schneiderman would slap women repeatedly during sex, without consent, and that he threatened to kill the women he dated.
In a statement announcing his resignation, Schneiderman said he ""strongly contests"" those claims, saying,
It's been my great honor and privilege to serve as Attorney General for the people of the State of New York. In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office's work at this critical time.
The allegations against Schneiderman are made all the more notable by the fact that he had positioned himself as a champion of women during his term, which including filing a civil rights lawsuit against Weinstein after allegations against him were reported.
Meanwhile, The New Yorker's report shared a common theme with other stories of alleged abuse: women who say they felt helpless because of the stature of the men they were accusing.
""What do you do if your abuser is the top law-enforcement official in the state?"" one accuser, Tanya Selvaratnam, asked in the story.

http://eagleforum.org/?p=26044,Thank President Trump for Defunding Abortion,"“A Bright Line” of Physical and Financial Separation in Title X
Pro-life Americans can rally behind Friday’s executive action that should stop Title X funding going to Planned Parenthood for abortions! We received word from the White House that President Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services is filing a proposal to protect life in the Title X Family Planning Grant Program. HHS will file with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a proposal to update the regulations governing the Title X program to ensure compliance with the program’s statutory prohibition on taxpayer funding of programs where abortion is a method of family planning.
There are 266 Planned Parenthood facilities which currently provide both chemical and surgical abortions in the same place as family planning services. Similar to the Reagan-era framework, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, the new proposal would require a “bright line of physical as well as financial separation between Title X Programs and any program or facility where abortion is performed, supported, or referred for as a method of family planning.” It will prohibit counseling for abortion, but not counseling about abortion. It will better protect victims of sexual assault, incest, and rape by requiring documentation of compliance with state reporting laws regarding potential victims.
Please thank President Trump for this significant move toward defunding Planned Parenthood.

Pro-life Americans can rally behind Friday’s executive action that should stop Title X funding going to Planned Parenthood for abortions! We received word from the White House that President Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services is filing a proposal to protect life in the Title X Family Planning Grant Program. HHS will file with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a proposal to update the regulations governing the Title X program to ensure compliance with the program’s statutory prohibition on taxpayer funding of programs where abortion is a method of family planning.
There are 266 Planned Parenthood facilities which currently provide both chemical and surgical abortions in the same place as family planning services. Similar to the Reagan-era framework, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, the new proposal would require a “bright line of physical as well as financial separation between Title X Programs and any program or facility where abortion is performed, supported, or referred for as a method of family planning.” It will prohibit counseling for abortion, but not counseling about abortion. It will better protect victims of sexual assault, incest, and rape by requiring documentation of compliance with state reporting laws regarding potential victims.
Please thank President Trump for this significant move toward defunding Planned Parenthood.

http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/17/illegal-aliens-have-no-constitutional-right-to-abortion-says-hhs/,"Illegal Aliens Have No Constitutional Right To Abortion, Says HHS","The Trump administration stated on Tuesday that pregnant illegal immigrants have no right to abortion in the United States.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made it clear that illegal minors do not have the right to abortion because they are not U.S. citizens. “The Office of Refugee Resettlement is providing excellent care to this young woman and her unborn child and fulfilling our duty to the American people. There is no constitutional right for a pregnant minor to illegally cross the U.S. border and get an elective abortion while in federal custody,” the Administration for Children and Families said in a a statement according to Politico. “We cannot cede our responsibility to care for minors and their babies by releasing them to ideological advocacy groups,” the HHS added.
The HHS statement comes after a federal judge in California refused to hear a case last week deciding whether the state of Texas must help a teenage illegal immigrant obtain an abortion. “The government has no business blocking Jane Doe’s abortion,” said Amiri after the judge’s refusal. (Related: Judge Refuses To Hear Case On Teenage Illegal Immigrant Who Wants An Abortion).
“There is a pattern of unconstitutional overreach of power in a minor’s abortion decision,” said one of the teen’s American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyers, Brigitte Amiri, in response to HHS’s announcement.
The ACLU’s original lawsuit posited that the HHS violated the First Amendment by refusing the girl an abortion. Even though the 17-year-old illegal immigrant received a judicial waiver allowing her — a minor — to get an abortion, the officers detaining her refused to take her to an abortion clinic, according to the Associated Press. The ACLU hoped to get an emergency court order from a judge allowing the girl to have an abortion.
Illegal immigrants do not have a constitutional right to abortion, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in regard to the case. Ruling in the girl’s favor would “create a right to abortion for anyone on earth who enters the U.S. illegally,” Paxton said. “And with that right, countless others undoubtedly would follow. Texas must not become a sanctuary state for abortions.”

http://www.dailywire.com/news/22368/abortion-activist-blocks-ben-shapiro-twitter-after-james-barrett,Shapiro Dismantles Pro-Abortion Author's Argument. What Happens Next Is Hilarious.,"On Tuesday, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro thoroughly dismantled a pro-abortion thought experiment posted by comic and author Patrick S. Tomlinson that went viral on Twitter. In response, Tomlinson tried to dismiss Shapiro's reasoned, meticulous response by vaguely saying Shapiro somehow ""missed the point"" — ironically proving that Tomlinson actually ""missed the point"" of the entire debate — and then, predictably, Tomlinson blocked Shapiro.
In a series of tweets posted Monday, Tomlinson lays out a thought experiment that he claims ""destroys"" pro-lifers' argument that ""life begins at conception."" Tomlinson claims that in ""ten years"" of presenting this thought experiment to those who want to protect unborn lives, ""no one has EVER answered it honestly."" Here's Tomlinson's entire thread in paragraph form:
Whenever abortion comes up, I have a question I've been asking for ten years now of the ""Life begins at Conception"" crowd. In ten years, no one has EVER answered it honestly. It's a simple scenario with two outcomes. No one ever wants to pick one, because the correct answer destroys their argument. And there IS a correct answer, which is why the pro-life crowd hates the question.
Here it is. You're in a fertility clinic. Why isn't important. The fire alarm goes off. You run for the exit. As you run down this hallway, you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You throw open the door and find a five-year-old child crying for help. They're in one corner of the room. In the other corner, you spot a frozen container labeled ""1000 Viable Human Embryos."" The smoke is rising. You start to choke. You know you can grab one or the other, but not both before you succumb to smoke inhalation and die, saving no one. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no ""C."" ""C"" means you all die.
In a decade of arguing with anti-abortion people about the definition of human life, I have never gotten a single straight A or B answer to this question. And I never will. They will never answer honestly, because we all instinctively understand the right answer is ""A."" A human child is worth more than a thousand embryos. Or ten thousand. Or a million. Because they are not the same, not morally, not ethically, not biologically. This question absolutely evicerates (sic) their arguments, and their refusal to answer confirms that they know it to be true.
No one, anywhere, actually believes an embryo is equivalent to a child. That person does not exist. They are lying to you. They are lying to you to try and evoke an emotional response, a paternal response, using false-equivalency. No one believes life begins at conception. No one believes embryos are babies, or children. Those who cliam (sic) to are trying to manipulate you so they can control women. Don't let them. Use this question to call them out. Reveal them for what they are. Demand they answer your question, and when they don't, slap that big ol' Scarlet P of the Patriarchy on them. The end.

Albert Einstein flees Nazi Germany and moves to the United States.
In a response published on Daily Wire, Shapiro demonstrates that Tomlinson's supposedly pro-life ""eviscerating"" argument is fundamentally flawed.
""Let’s put aside Tomlinson’s obvious douchiness; the commenters on the Twitter thread are properly puzzled,"" writes Shapiro. ""That’s because Tomlinson is correct that we all have a moral instinct: to save the five-year-old. But he’s wrong if he thinks the hypothetical proves that embryos aren’t human life or potential human life, and therefore of no value.""
Shapiro, who answers directly that he would and should save the 5-year-old child's life, lays out four reasons that Tomlinson's supposedly original thought experiment, while ""interesting,"" is ultimately worthless. Shapiro argues that 1) ""moral instinct does not always mean correct moral decisionmaking""; 2) the pro-abortion thought experiment ""does not reveal the value of embryonic life""; 3) ""most pro-lifers freely admit the supreme value of already-born human life, but that doesn’t make prenatal life valueless""; and 4) the whole thought experiment simply isn't reality: ""the case of pro-abortion advocates isn’t a choice between a five-year-old and a thousand fetuses. It’s a case of killing a fetus, by itself."" (Read Shapiro's full rebuttal here.)
After claiming to have gotten ""another thousand"" followers by the time he woke up Tuesday morning, Tomlinson eventually saw Shapiro's rebuttal and tweeted, ""Watch @benshapiro prove the point while missing it entirely. It's really a sight to see,"" with a link to Shapiro's article.
Proving that he does not fully understand Shapiro's response or the implications of his own argument, Tomlinson responded to Shapiro's initial tweet of his article by writing, ""Exactly. You would save the 5 yr old. Thank you for proving the point.""
The responses online to Tomlinson's claim that Shapiro somehow proved his point was brutal, with even pro-abortion followers slamming Tomlinson for failing to understand the discussion he had started. At first Tomlinson replied but then quickly disappeared:
Tomlinson went on to block Shapiro on Twitter.

http://www.dailywire.com/news/22426/pro-abortion-topless-feminists-attack-catholic-amanda-prestigiacomo,Pro-Abortion Topless Feminists Attack Catholic Church With Firebombs And Poop,"On Sunday, some 40,000 pro-abortion topless feminists hit the streets of Resistencia, Argentina, to demand taxpayer-funded on-demand abortion and the legalization of prostitution in a so-called ""Boob Protest.""
The Argentina government adheres to the scientific truth that human life begins at conception and outright outlaws abortion except for rare cases where the mother is deemed in danger.
According to a report from Crux, some of the ""boob protesters"" attacked buildings and a Catholic church in Pope Francis' native country with tampons and pads covered in red paint, rocks, a Molotov cocktail, feces, inflamed garbage cans, and balloons filled with paint.
“To the Catholic, apostolic, Roman Church, that wants to place itself in our bed, we say that we want to be whores, transvestites and lesbians,"" reportedly chanted the women. “If the pope was a woman, abortion would be law,” they also yelled.
The totally sane feminists also painted the phrases, “death to the pope,” “abort the macho,” and “lesbianize yourself"" on nearby public buildings.
Moreover, the boob protest participants were allowed access to some interesting workshops:
There were 71 workshops for participants, including “Women and feminism,” which focused on taking the patriarchy out of politics, “Women and sexuality,” “Women and lesbianism,” “Women and maternity,” “Women and sexual and reproductive rights,” “Strategies for legal, safe and free abortion,” “Women and disabilities,” “Women in the fight against drug addiction and drug trafficking,” “Women and cannabis,” “Violence, abuse and sexual harassment,” “Femicides,” and “Feminization of poverty.”
As reported by The Daily Wire in March, feminists in Argentina staged an abortion of baby Jesus outside of a Catholic church.

I was crying when they wheeled me in, I woke up crying after’ - How Universal Credit rules force women into abortions","When Sally came round from the anaesthetic her cheeks were already wet with tears.
She had been fully sedated while the doctors terminated her four-month pregnancy, a pregnancy she had desperately wanted to continue.
“I was crying when wheeled me in,” she says. “They kept asking ‘are you sure you want to do this?’ and I couldn’t even answer, I just had to nod my head.”
Sally is not her real name but she says she could not bear for family and friends to know what she went through. She and her partner discovered, almost halfway through the pregnancy, that the government no longer paid out child tax credit and the child element of universal credit for more than two children.
The rule applies to babies born after 6th April 2017 and it’s been widely condemned by women’s rights organisations, religious leaders and child poverty campaigners.
Last month the charity Turn2us , which helps people understand and access welfare benefits, tweeted that it had seen a “worrying trend” of pregnant women contacting them with questions about the benefits they are entitled to and saying they may have to terminate their pregnancies as a result.
Sally’s story bears that out. She and her partner already have two children; boys aged 4 and 5. She’s currently receiving Universal Credit after being found fit for work following 12 years on employment and support allowance as she suffers from PTSD.
“I don't live with my partner as we can't afford to,” she explains. “[The pregnancy] wasn't planned as such but it wasn't avoided.
""We were happy to have another child if it happened and we had discussed after the last one was born that we would be very happy to have another child.""
Sally explained her partner is looking for work, but finds it hard.
“He is currently studying to be a personal trainer so he can earn money to support us.""
Squirming Theresa May backs Tory Esther McVey's claim that the rape clause 'supports' women
“It wasn’t planned but it was very wanted”
Knowing that money would be tight but trusting to her partner’s future earning potential and the safety net of our benefits system, Sally began to buy bits for the baby and booked in for a scan.
It was her third successful pregnancy so she knew what to expect and was delighted when she began to feel kicks and movement.
Then she heard news that changed everything. “I was four months along and planning what other things we would need to buy for this baby, and then my friend said any child born after 2017 you will not get any extra money for.
“I said that cannot possibly be true.”
But it was, and Sally and her partner were forced to make a decision they would not have contemplated otherwise. “We are barely surviving now,” says Sally.
Have you had a similar experience and are willing to talk about it? Contact us using the form below.
Sally's choice - 'I think it's something I will never forgive myself for'
“I knew we couldn't do it to the children already born and we couldn't do it to the unborn child,"" Sally said.
""We thought we could make it work somehow but, honestly, even if we both got a job and 85% of our childcare paid for we still could not afford childcare let alone food.”
Cancelling a scan and midwife appointments, Sally instead booked herself in for a termination. At four months gone that could no longer be a swift appointment, she needed a general anaesthetic and an operation.
“I cried at every appointment regarding the termination and I woke up crying from the operation as well,” she said.
“I think it's something I will never forgive myself for. I know I should have prevented it from happening in the first place. My partner was devastated but he tried not to show any emotion because I was so upset.
“He also couldn't come with me as he had to look after our children so I went alone.”
Even as the couple prepared to end the pregnancy they tried to find a way to make it work.
“Even on the day he kept saying: ‘Are we sure we should do this? There must be some way that we can keep it.’”
In desperation, they even discussed whether her partner should earn money in less legitimate ways. “He was ready to turn back to crime to support us,” admitted Sally. “But I said if he is in jail how can I cope alone with 3 kids and no money?”
It’s left Sally questioning whether politicians have any regard or respect for her children, and what kind of system leaves her with no choice but to abort a wanted pregnancy or rely on crime to get by.
“I feel guilty, ashamed, angry. The Government does not value my right to a family at all or my family, I'm being penalised for being born poor.
“I have two sons but I've been denied the chance to have a daughter unless we live in complete and utter poverty. I’m disgusted by the Government; I think a two-child limit is sick and disgusting.”
Hardworking mum hits out at Tory cuts to child tax credits on Question Time
Cruellest cut of all
For some people, Sally’s desperate story is the new system working. It’s a woman limiting her family size because she cannot afford to do otherwise.
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has described the two-child limit as ‘ensur[ing] that the benefits system is fair to those who pay for it, as well as those who benefit from it, ensuring those on benefits face the same financial choices around the number of children they can afford as those supporting themselves through work’.
It’s a point that completely disregards the fact that 70% of those claiming tax credits are in work, according to the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG). And it ignores the desperation of women like Sally, forced to abort pregnancies they want to keep.
Of course, financial considerations often play a perfectly valid role in whether a woman decides to continue with a pregnancy. Yet the two-child limit has been roundly criticised for simply stripping away the safety net for third or more children.
The News Explained - What are 'benefits' and how was the welfare state created?
Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at abortion provider the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), tells us: “Financial pressures, job or housing insecurity are often among key reasons for women deciding to end an unwanted pregnancy.
“But the third child benefit cap is more than that because it penalises those already in the most challenging financial circumstances – and as anti-poverty campaigners have noted, it breaks what has been a fundamental link between need and the provision of support, and also discriminates against children simply because of the order they were born in.
And she’s scathing about the idea that before the cap women were having ‘benefit broods’ purposefully to gain payments.
“As a charity that has spent the last five decades counselling pregnant women, we know that women don’t decide to continue with pregnancies because they think they could make a bit of money doing so - £7.60 per day to be precise, when it comes to child tax credit for poorer families,"" Clare said.
“They do so because that child is wanted and would be a much-loved addition to their family.”
What’s more, this rule implies that women can always control their fertility when in fact they don’t even have an automatic right to abortion if their contraception lets them down.
“Contraception frequently fails women,” said Clare. “More than half of women we see for advice about unplanned pregnancy were using contraception when they conceived, including many women using the effective hormonal methods.
“We have seen cuts to contraceptive services and one reason BPAS campaigned so hard last year to bring the price of emergency contraception down was because we feared some women were simply being priced out of protection when their regular method failed.
“Ministers speak about people having to make ‘choices’ about the number of children in their families. It is important to note that women in the UK still do not have the right to choose abortion – it can only be provided if two doctors agree that she meets certain criteria and the abortion takes places in specific licensed premises, unlike any other medical procedure.”
Protecting children must be the priority
Pritie Billimoria, head of communications at Turn2us, said: “A third child is worth no more or no less than a first or second born.
“No parent can see into the future. Parents may be able to comfortably support a third child today but may be a bereavement, divorce or redundancy away from needing state help. We need to see children protected from growing up in poverty in the UK and that means scrapping this limit.”
It’s also been roundly criticised by religious leaders: 60 Church of England bishops joined the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Muslim Council of Britain to call for the policy to be scrapped.
This Government has removed benefits from children who simply have no say in being born or in the number of existing children in their families and the results are already showing.
CPAG estimates that more than 250,000 children will be pushed into poverty as a result of this measure by the end of the decade, representing a 10% increase in child poverty. Meanwhile a similar number of children already living in poverty will fall deeper into poverty.
If those numbers don’t move ministers then it seems unlikely that poor Sally’s story will, as she attended her appointment to end her pregnancy on her own and feeling the kicks.
A Government spokesperson told us: “This policy ensures fairness between claimants and those who support themselves solely through work. We’ve always been clear the right exceptions are in place and consulted widely on them.”
However Clare from bpas puts it simply: “We see abortion as a fundamental part of women’s healthcare and something which should be a genuine matter of choice – no woman should be left in the position of undergoing abortion because she simply would not be able to put food on the plate or clothes on the back of a new baby.
“As one of the world’s biggest economies, surely we can do better than that.”

The house passed the bill to ban late term abortions on Tuesday, meaning no more legal abortions after 20-weeks. This is a huge step, but we are not out of the woods yet.
According to the bill, which was sponsored by Republican Trent Franks, criminalizes the act of performing or attempting an abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy. The consequences may include: a fine, five years in prison, or both.
The Hill reports:
The measure passed heavily along party lines, 237-189.
The bill allows exceptions in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the woman and wouldn’t penalize women for seeking to get abortions after 20 weeks.
The legislation is likely to face a tough sell in the Senate. A similar bill passed the House in 2015 but was blocked by Senate Democrats.
With only a 52-seat majority it would be unlikely Senate Republicans could gather the 60 votes needed to move the legislation to President Trump’s desk.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday he would reintroduce a companion bill in the Senate soon.
The White House said Monday that it “strongly supports” the bill and “applauds the House of Representatives for continuing its efforts to secure critical pro-life protections.”
As President Donald Trump said, this bill was of top priority, and many pro-life groups have been pushing it for a long time. They claim that a baby can feel pain at that age and on.
To be honest I can’t believe we are still having this discussion. If we declare a person dead when their heart stops beating, why do we not consider them alive when their heart starts? Abortion is murder. Plain and simple.
Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said, “It’s past time for Congress to pass a nationwide law protecting unborn children from the unspeakable cruelty of late-term abortion.”
Of course the pro-choicers are angry and have condemned the bill. They think that women should have the choice to murder their child at any point in the pregnancy.
It’s sick and demented. The ban on late term abortions is a step forward for our society as a whole. Feminists want to whine that is infringes on women’s rights. Here’s my question: What about the rights of the little baby girls they’re murdering?

COLUMBIA CITY, Oregon, April 18, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Like 60% of Americans, Michael Bowman opposes taxpayer funding of abortion. Unlike most Americans, he is currently squaring off against the Internal Revenue Service to avoid doing so.
Bowman is a 53-year-old Christian and contract engineer in Columbia City, Oregon. He has refused to file a tax return or pay taxes since 1999, The Oregonian reports, citing the federal government’s funding of the abortion industry.
“I’m not a tax protester. I love my country,” he told the paper. “I have a duty to my country. I have a duty to my conscience.”
The IRS has sent him numerous warnings over unpaid taxes from 2002 to 2014, and in 2012 the Oregon Department of Revenue began garnishing money from Bowman’s bank account. In response, he started cashing out his paychecks and leaving only a minimum balance in his account.
This, federal prosecutors say, constituted “remov[ing] his income from the reach of taxing authorities.” They indicted him for felony tax evasion in the amount of $356,857, as well as four misdemeanor counts of willful failure to file tax returns.
Bowman’s attorney, Matthew Schindler, argued that his client was fully transparent every step of the way, from disclosing all of his paychecks to cashing them at his own bank, under his own name.
“Like a player collapsing as they lose Twister, the government has reached too far forward and stretched way too far back,” his motion to dismiss read.
Last week, US District Judge Michael Mosman sided with Bowman on the felony charge, ruling that the feds failed to show he attempted to conceal income or deceive the government. Prosecutors remain free to re-introduce the charge in the future, and are currently weighing whether to do so.
On Tuesday, Bowman elaborated on his stand in an interview with CBN News.
“First, I would love to pay taxes so as to have a normal life, however, our government is using the tax dollars to fund Planned Parenthood; which commits abortions – the death of the innocent,” Bowman said. “Apparently, a woman has the right to choose, but evidently, I do not.”
He also took aim at the common rejoinder that every American citizen has to pay taxes for things with which they might personally disagree, such as war. “You see, the Constitution grants certain abilities to the government, e.g. funding the military, but killing children is not a Constitutional backed, compelling interest of the government by any stretch of the imagination,” Bowman explained.
Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million per year from the federal government, and performs more than 300,000 abortions. Federal law forbids taxpayer dollars from being directly spent on abortions, though pro-life groups arguethat the money still enables abortion facilities to grow their reach and influence, and spend more revenue from other sources on abortions.
“All the government has to do is put a check box on the tax forms that says check here to support Planned Parenthood, and write in your donation amount,” Bowman proposed. “Then, just like any church or charity, Planned Parenthood will be funded by those that have no problem with it, and the 150 million people like me that are pro-life, can pay their taxes and live knowing we kept our conscience clean.”
He vowed that he will continue his resistance as long as the government continues funding the abortion industry.
“My effort [is] about standing up, standing firm for my Constitutional rights, and getting the government to honor title 42 Chapter 21.b The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, so that I may live a peaceful life, and in the end face God, and hopefully have Him say, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant!” he said.

This undercover footage was taken during the annual conventions of the National Abortion Federation in 2014 and 2015, and perhaps the most disturbing moment is when one abortionist jokes about an eyeball rolling into her lap. All of the undercover videos that have been released by the Center For Medical Progress are very startling and very graphic, but it is absolutely imperative that the American people be told the truth about what is actually happening in these abortion clinics. If these crimes against humanity do not stop, there is no hope and no future for our nation.
Defunding Planned Parenthood is “not just another political issue”, and we can no longer afford to elect politicians that use the “Pro-Life” label to get votes but then continue to vote to fund Planned Parenthood once they take office.
Every single day precious little babies are being ripped limb from limb and their body parts are being sold off for profit.
And the new undercover video that was recently released shows some of these abortionists actually making jokes about what they are doing…
The Center For Medical Progress released a new undercover video showing Planned Parenthood executives discussing gruesome abortion procedures and the sale of fetal body parts for profit. The video was filmed at the 2014 and 2015 annual meetings of the National Abortion Federation.
The new undercover video appears to be a preview of a longer project, and is a compilation of comments made by Planned Parenthood executives and other abortion supporters at the NAF conventions. During conversations and panel discussions, the PP executives make stunning comments about abortion procedures.
Several attendees made jokes about eyeballs and other fetal body parts “rolling down into their laps.” Others laughed as they discussed how hard it is to remove the unborn baby’s head from the womb.
You can view the entire video from the Center For Medical Progress on YouTube right here.
It is time for the Pro-Life community to stand up and tell our politicians that defunding Planned Parenthood is no longer optional.
If they will not pledge to vote against every single bill that includes even a single penny of funding for Planned Parenthood, they will not get our votes.
How much more do we have to see before we are willing to take a stand? The following summary of the undercover videos that the Center For Medical Progress has released so far comes from LifeNews.com…
In the first video: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m gonna basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”
In the second video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, “I want a Lamborghini” as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.
In the third video: Holly O’Donnell, a former Stem Express employee who worked inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, detailed first-hand the unspeakable atrocities and how she fainted in horror over handling baby legs.
In the fourth video: Planned Parenthood’s Dr. Savita Ginde stated, “We don’t want to do just a flat-fee (per baby) of like, $200. A per-item thing works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get out of it.” She also laughed while looking at a plate of fetal kidneys that were “good to go.”
In the fifth video: Melissa Farrell of Planned Parenthood-Gulf Coast in Houston boasted of Planned Parenthood’s skill in obtaining “intact fetal cadavers” and how her “research” department “contributes so much to the bottom line of our organization here, you know we’re one of the largest affiliates, our Research Department is the largest in the United States.”
In the sixth video: Holly O’Donnell described technicians taking fetal parts without patient consent: “There were times when they would just take what they wanted. And these mothers don’t know. And there’s no way they would know.”
In the seventh and perhaps most disturbing video: Holly O’Donnell described the harvesting, or “procurement,” of organs from a nearly intact late-term fetus aborted at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte’s Alameda clinic in San Jose, CA. “‘You want to see something kind of cool,’” O’Donnell says her supervisor asked her. “And she just taps the heart, and it starts beating. And I’m sitting here and I’m looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think.”
In the eighth video: StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer admits Planned Parenthood sells “a lot of” fully intact aborted babies.
The ninth video: catches a Planned Parenthood medical director discussing how the abortion company sells fully intact aborted babies — including one who “just fell out” of the womb.
The 10th video: catches the nation’s biggest abortion business selling specific body parts — including the heart, eyes and “gonads” of unborn babies. The video also shows the shocking ways in which Planned Parenthood officials admit that they are breaking federal law by selling aborted baby body parts for profit.
Unreleased Videos: Unreleased videos from CMP show Deb Vanderhei of Planned Parenthood caught on tape talking about how Planned Parenthood abortion business affiliates may “want to increase revenue [from selling baby parts] but we can’t stop them…” Another video has a woman talking about the “financial incentives” of selling aborted baby body parts.
The 11th video: catches a Texas Planned Parenthood abortionist planning to sell the intact heads of aborted babies for research. Amna Dermish is caught on tape describing an illegal partial-birth abortion procedure to terminate living, late-term unborn babies which she hopes will yield intact fetal heads for brain harvesting.
The 12th video in the series shows new footage of Jennefer Russo, medical director at Planned Parenthood in Orange County, California, describing to undercover investigators how her abortion business tries to harvest intact aborted babies’ bodies for a local for-profit biotech company and changes the abortion procedure to do so.
The 13th video: exposes a Planned Parenthood medical director admitting that babies born alive after abortion are sometimes killed.
As I stated yesterday, I greatly applaud President Trump for proposing a budget that would completely defund Planned Parenthood.
Unfortunately, his budget is not going to get through Congress.
There are several Republican senators that are against defunding Planned Parenthood, and we need to make it clear to them that such a stance is no longer acceptable.
In particular, senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are threatening to hold up the effort to repeal Obamacare over this issue. The following comes from the Hill…
And with majorities in the House and Senate and control of the White House, the goal seems within reach after years of the party being thwarted by Senate Democrats and former President Barack Obama.
The problem is that Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) both may oppose a healthcare bill that cuts off funding to Planned Parenthood.
Collins is not up for re-election until 2020, and Murkowski is not up for re-election until 2022. But one pro-Planned Parenthood senator that we can remove from Congress in 2018 is Dean Heller of Nevada…
Forcing a fight over Planned Parenthood would also put a focus on Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who is up for reelection in 2018 in a state won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Heller sparked criticism from both conservatives and liberals after he said at a recent town hall that he has “no problem” with federal funding for Planned Parenthood and would “protect” it.
Because he is in favor of funding Planned Parenthood, Heller has forfeited any future support from Pro-Life conservatives.
So we need a Senate candidate in Nevada for 2018. I know that there are a lot of good Pro-Life people that live in the state, and if you are thinking of running for that seat please feel free to reach out to me.
For decades Pro-Life activists have been writing letters, holding marches and trying to make our voices heard, but the politicians have been ignoring us.
Now it is time for us to rise up and demand that they listen to us by denying our votes to any politician that will not vote to defund Planned Parenthood every single time.
Nearly 60 million children have already died, and many more will die this year.
If we are not willing to take action now, when will we ever be?

http://www.vindy.com/news/2018/may/04/iowa-governor-signs-strictest-abortion-regulation-/,Iowa governor signs strictest abortion regulation in US,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds today signed a law banning most abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, or at about six weeks of pregnancy, marking the strictest abortion regulation in the nation – but setting the state up for a lengthy court fight.
The Republican governor signed the legislation in her formal office at the state Capitol as protesters gathered outside chanting, ""My body, my choice!"" Reynolds acknowledged the new law would likely face litigation, but said: ""This is bigger than just a law, this is about life, and I'm not going to back down."" Reynolds has previously said she was ""proud to be pro-life.""
The ban, set to take effect July 1, has propelled Iowa to the front of a push among conservative statehouses jockeying to enact restrictive regulations on the medical procedure. Mississippi passed a law earlier this year banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but it's on hold after a court challenge.
The Iowa law provides for some exemptions that allow abortions during a later pregnancy stage to save a pregnant woman's life or in some cases of rape and incest.
Maggie DeWitte, who leads the group Iowans for Life, called Reynolds' move ""historic.""
""We couldn't be more pleased,"" DeWitte said today. ""She is following through on her pledge to the people of Iowa that she is 100 percent pro-life.""
The bill signing came shortly after the Iowa affiliates of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union warned that they would sue the governor if she signed the bill, which the Republican-controlled Legislature quickly approved in after-hours votes earlier in the week.
""We will challenge this law with absolutely everything we have on behalf of our patients because Iowa will not go back,"" Suzanna de Baca, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, said in a statement.

http://www.vindy.com/news/2018/may/04/anti-abortion-activist-shared-tips-dewine-probe/,Anti-abortion activist shared tips in DeWine probe,"Tweet
COLUMBUS (AP) — A Cincinnati anti-abortion activist was in regular contact with Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine’s office during a 2015 Planned Parenthood investigation and some of her input was shared with state investigators, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press.
The records shed new light on the internal handling of an investigation DeWine launched in response to a secretly taped video that appeared to show Planned Parenthood employees engaged in potentially illegal fetal tissue sales.
DeWine, an abortion opponent and gubernatorial candidate, ultimately found no such tissue sales by the abortion provider, but raised concerns about Planned Parenthood’s disposal of fetal remains that he said had to be addressed.
The documents show Paula Westwood, executive director of Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati, emailed DeWine’s community liaison detailed suggestions for carrying out the probe, including names, addresses and a lawyer to consult.
The liaison, Richard D. “Dee” Weghorst, forwarded some of Westwood’s communications to senior staff members, including chief of staff Mary Mertz, chief counsel Sheryl Creed Maxfield and then-policy director Ryan Stubenrauch, who’s now the spokesman for DeWine’s gubernatorial campaign.
Also, Robert Schmansky, a lawyer involved in the investigation, reported to Maxfield in an Aug. 10, 2015, email that he’d spoken with Westwood by phone. He said she passed along two tips regarding the relationship between Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and alleged stem-cell research at the hospital using fetal tissues.
Schmansky noted that Westwood “conceded that she has no direct information,” but told Maxfield: “I will follow-up with Pete (Thomas, chief of the Charitable Law Section) on how we might incorporate any of this information into our investigation.”
Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio, a nonpartisan government watchdog group, said state investigations need to be impartial and appearing to give special access to those with a particular political ideology is potentially problematic for DeWine.
“It is easier to understand a quid pro quo of a financial situation than with making investigative decisions based on ideology and your cozy relationships, but it’s still a conflict of interest,” she said.
Westwood said in an interview that she did not know Maxfield and could not recall ever speaking with Schmansky on the phone. She said Weghorst is her organization’s regional contact at the office.
“There is a concern that there may be some activity going on that is shady and, essentially, it was ‘Have you looked into this? This may be a possibility.’ That’s about it,” Westwood said. “I would say, as any citizen can, these are our public officials and we can ask these questions. I see their office as (a place) both Right to Life and Planned Parenthood can access for information or to ask them to look into certain things.”

Kim Reynolds on Friday signed a law banning most abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, or at around six weeks of pregnancy, marking the strictest abortion regulation in the nation — but setting the state up for a lengthy court fight.
The Republican governor signed the legislation in her formal office at the state Capitol as protesters gathered outside chanting, ""My body, my choice!""

""We will challenge this law with absolutely everything we have on behalf of our patients because Iowa will not go back,"" Suzanna de Baca, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, said in a statement.
Backers of the so-called heartbeat bill — which didn't get a single Democratic vote in the Legislature during final passage — expressed hope it could challenge Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that established women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a fetus is viable. Conservatives say an influx of right-leaning judicial appointments under President Donald Trump could make it a possibility.
Critics argued the bill would ban abortions before some women even know they're pregnant. That likely sets the state up for a legal challenge, including from the same federal appeals court that three years ago struck down similar legislation approved in Arkansas and North Dakota.
In Iowa, the same Republican-majority Legislature passed a 20-week abortion ban last year. It's now in effect, though a provision requiring a three-day waiting period to get an abortion is tied up in a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. Still, Republican lawmakers indicated they would push for more restrictions this session.
Outside of Reynolds' office earlier Friday, critics of the bill began leaving coat hangers by her staff's desks. The protests followed the morning rally outside of the Capitol where more than 100 people showed up to oppose the legislation. One of them was Georgia Jecklin, a retired teacher who drove in from Davenport.

http://faithit.com/frank-stephens-slams-abortion-final-answer-congress,WATCH: Man With Down Syndrome Slams Abortion as the ‘Final Solution’ Before Congress,"As a writer, Frank Stephens has made regular appearances on well-known publications like The Huffington Post, London Daily Mail and The New York Times; as an actor, he’s has made guest appearances on Emmy award-winning shows.
He is a respected member of theater group Artstream, where he has had the opportunity to act in multiple original plays over the last decade, and he recently signed with a Hollywood talent agency that landed him a feature role in the movie Touched by Grace.
Frank is a Quincy Jones Exceptional Advocacy Award winner, and he has made two trips to the White House.
He has led a FULL and meaningful life.
He also has Down Syndrome.
And as his track record chock-full of accomplishments and meaningful contributions to society can attest, that does not make his life worth ANY less.
“Whatever you learn today, please remember this: I am a man with Down Syndrome and my life is worth living,” said Stephens in a powerful speech before Congress on Wednesday.
Amidst an era that aims to eradicate Down Syndrome once and for all, the Quincy Jones Advocate for the Global Down Syndrome Foundation boldly defended his right to life:
“Some people say prenatal screens will identify Down Syndrome in the womb, and those pregnancies will just be terminated. It’s hard for me to sit here and say those words. I completely understand that the people pushing this particular ‘final solution’ are saying that people like me should not exist… But to those who question the value of people with Down Syndrome, I would make three points: First, we are a medical gift to society, a blueprint for medical research into cancer, Alzheimer’s, and immune system disorders.”
Stephens elaborated, on a more personal note, that he is deeply pained by the effect that Alzheimer’s will likely have on his own life and the life of his mother.
“It’s likely that one day this thief will steal my memories, my very life from me,” he said. “This is very hard for me to say, but it has already begun to steal my mom from me.”
Stephens challenged attendees to “think about all those people you love the way I love my mom,” citing that we should be a country in pursuit of answers that restore—not eradicate humanity.
In contrast to countries like Iceland that boast a 100 percent abortion rate for Down Syndrome babies, Stephens pleas that we be the exception:
“Help us make this difference, if not for me and my mom, then for you and the ones you love. Fund this research. Let’s be America, not Iceland or Denmark. Let’s pursue answers, not final solutions. Let’s be America. Let’s make our goal to be Alzheimer’s free, not Down Syndrome free.”

http://faithit.com/focus-family-pregnancy-care-center-dixie-stops-abortion,"“Don’t You Dare Get Out of This Bed”: Pregnant Mom Makes Abortion Appointment, Then Her Baby’s Heartbeat Changes Everything","Like most women who learn they are unexpectedly pregnant, Dixie immediately started processing through all of her options.
“When I took the pregnancy test at home, my first reaction was disbelief,” she told Focus on the Family.
Thinking there was no way she could keep this baby, Dixie made an appointment to have an abortion.
“My mind was already made up. And nobody was going to change it.”
But God had different plans for Dixie and her unborn baby. Dixie’s mother brought her into a Focus on the Family care center, hoping that by talking with someone and getting an ultrasound of her baby—living, growing, developing inside of her—Dixie might change her mind.
Focus on the Family provides a wide array of options for expecting mothers, including licensed and experienced Christian counselors, resources on how to approach unexpected pregnancy, clinic care for family planning, and a plethora of other resources in making decisions for your future and that of your child.
When Dixie first saw her daughter on the ultrasound screen for the first time, she immediately knew she couldn’t terminate her. Hearing the heartbeat pumping through her baby inside of her, Dixie was given hope for a future that just minutes before looked very grim.
“It was life-changing.”
Rather than attending her abortion appointment the following morning, Dixie stayed in bed, and told herself she couldn’t possibly go through with it, having seen and heard with her own eyes the LIFE she had experienced inside of her the day before.
“I just rolled back over and told myself ‘don’t you dare get out of this bed,'” recalled Dixie after her alarm went off. “And I did, all day actually crying.”
If it weren’t for Dixie’s mother, and the resources provided by Focus on the Family, Dixie would have never known the joy and LIFE she was giving up at an abortion clinic.
Specializing in abortions, Planned Parenthood does not offer an ultrasound like what Dixie was able to get prior to choosing termination. That means that a mother is making a decision to end a life with no prior knowledge of just how much they’re giving up.
For Dixie, getting an ultrasound was the difference between life and death for her daughter.
According to Focus on the Family, more than a million unborn babies will be aborted in America this year. With the help of their Option Ultrasound program, hundreds of thousands of babies will be given a fair chance at life, and their mothers will be surrounded by people and resources who can help them through the unthinkable.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/06/kevin-williamson-atlantic-fired-hanging-women-who-have-abortion-column/491590002/,Kevin Williamson is wrong. Hanging women who have an abortion is not pro-life,"Kevin Williamson wasn't fired by 'The Atlantic' for being anti-abortion or having 'mainstream' conservative views. He was fired for wanting women to suffer.
Is it out of bounds to argue that women should be hanged for having an abortion?
An actual debate is raging over this question following yesterday’s firing of conservative writer Kevin Williamson from The Atlantic for expressing this view on multiple occasions. Williamson apparently believes this is “pro-life.”
Conservatives fanned out to attack The Atlantic and “the Left” for their closed- mindedness in not embracing a view that calls for the humiliating, torturous killing by the state of women who have had an abortion.
Commentary’s Noah Rothman called Williamson’s firing “chilling” and The Resurgent’s Eric Erickson said that it was all “about the left wanting a monopoly on the public square so none can be exposed to competing ideas.” The American Conservative’s Rod Dreher tweeted, “The Atlantic's cutting [Williamson] loose under left-wing fire is deplorable. But clarifying. Definitely clarifying.”
Reason’s Katherine Mangu-Ward wrote, “The Atlantic is essentially declaring that it cannot stomach real, mainstream conservatism as it actually exists in 21st century America.”
More: CNN, journalists should have no pity for anonymous internet trolls
Here is Williamson’s view as expressed in a podcast: “I would totally go with treating [abortion] like any other crime up to and including hanging -- which kind of, as I said, I’m kind of squishy about capital punishment in general, but I’ve got a soft spot for hanging as a form of capital punishment. I tend to think that things like lethal injection are a little too antiseptic.”
“I’ve got a soft spot for hanging.”
Little Green Footballs’ Charles Taylor hit the nail on the head in a Twitter debate with Williamson about his view: “You don’t just want these women to die, you want them to suffer.”
But according to Williamson’s defenders, this is just another viewpoint like, say, believing in supply-side economics or that the government is too big. It’s “mainstream conservativism,” apparently.
Except it’s not. It’s not even mainstream among conservative anti-abortion rights organizations. When candidate Donald Trump said in an interview that he thought women should be punished for abortions, the rebukes were swift and mighty. The March for Life put out a statement saying, “No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion. This is against the very nature of what we are about.” The National Right to Life Committee also released a statement making clear that it has never supported penalties against women who undergo abortions. Trump was forced to reverse his position to say that should abortion be outlawed, the only person who would be held accountable would be the doctor, not the woman. Even Trump didn’t gleefully muse about hanging people.
Williamson seems to believe his way of thinking is merely the intellectually consistent view. He says abortion is murder, and murderers (sometimes) get the death penalty — though typically not by hanging, unless you live under the Taliban — ergo women who have abortions should get the death penalty. Easy peasy. Yet the Catholic Church, of which Williamson is a member, has somehow managed to be opposed to both abortion and the death penalty.
Where I find common cause with Williamson’s defenders is in their concern that intellectual diversity is lacking in our society’s cultural institutions whether it’s the media or academia. In fact, I wrote an entire book on the topic. I just don’t think this event is a good example of that phenomenon.
While we should afford wide latitude for what people can say in public without fear of sanction in an effort to encourage vigorous debate, no publication is obligated to hire people who express views that violate their ethos. For example, is anyone criticizing the National Review for not having a marquee pro-abortion rights liberal columnist, let alone one who is making an argument that is outside the farthest fringe of what abortion rights organizations support?
More: New China worry for Donald Trump: Can U.S. win propaganda war against 'Voice of China'?
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
It is nonsensical to say that the firing of Williamson proves the Atlantic can’t tolerate ideological differences. The Atlantic is a center-left publication, yet they hired Williamson knowing he was an articulate conservative who opposes abortion rights.
What the Atlantic didn’t know was the callousness and inhumanity with which Williamson discusses women who’ve had an abortion.
To suggest, as many have, that he was fired for being “pro-life” is ridiculous. He was fired for being unable to have a reasoned, civil debate about abortion that doesn’t involve fantasizing not just about the government killing women who get abortions, but about how they kill them.
This is a reasonable standard for a magazine to have. Turning Kevin Williamson into a free speech martyr helps nobody, least of all the cause of intellectual diversity and free speech.

https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/09/abortion-facts-you-can-swallow/,The Abortion Pill: Facts You Can Swallow,"Let’s be real: pretty much anyone who isn’t a cisgender man has long had their bodily autonomy systematically threatened.
But, over the last several months, it has become increasingly apparent just how far politicians are willing to go to control and prevent access to [reproductive] health care and services.
In the United States — as in many other countries in the world — the powers that be have been tireless in their attempts to put up roadblocks to deny safe access to abortion and reproductive health care services.
But today’s current administration has taken these already grave circumstances to new heights with a steady bombardment of fake news and science, increased stigma, threats to the Affordable Care Act, and widespread religious extremism aimed at preventing progress in this sphere.
Today, on International Safe Abortion Day, we at Everyday Feminism want to take the opportunity to highlight the important issue of abortion access — something that poses a grave threat to millions of people, especially women of color, immigrants, and people from low-income backgrounds.
Below is a new video by Lady Parts Justice League that breaks down many of the myths around abortion, specifically the abortion pill.
Abortion has been historically demonized, but now, with growing threats to reproductive health, the stakes are higher than ever. We must rise to the occasion and ensure that everyone can gain access to safe abortions and reproductive care when and if they need it.

While this case is far from over — there is a legal hitch involving attaching a Texas plaintiff to a California suit — it is a promising win in favor of numerous young women who complained that they are not only being shamed by the federal employees holding them in custody, but they are being blocked from medical procedures after jumping through all necessary hoops to secure them.
“The government may not want to facilitate abortion,” ruled U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler. “But it cannot block it. It is doing that here.” However, Judge Beeler stopped short of filing the order that would officially bar Homeland Security from denying Jane Doe access to her abortion. That’s because she’s a California judge weighing in on a case opposed by the Texas attorney general, but Doe’s attorneys can now secure a ruling in the proper court.
Jane Doe, a minor, successfully sought a judicial waver in lieu of parental consent so that she could get an abortion. Despite going through the proper legal channels, the Office of Refugee Resettlement and Homeland Security refused to transport Jane Doe to get the procedure. Instead, they insisted she go to a religiously affiliated crisis pregnancy center. There, she was forced to get a sonogram from a non-medical technician. Jane Doe told the court, “I feel like they are trying to coerce me to carry my pregnancy to term.”
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton fears that if future rulings on the case follow the lead of the California judge’s findings it will turn Texas into “a sanctuary state for abortion.” He’s not alone in that concern — attorney generals from Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Carolina joined him on his brief.

A young undocumented immigrant held in a Texas detention center sought an abortion, only to be denied the requested medical care by the federal government on the grounds that her parents aren’t here to sign off on the procedure. Now she’s at the center of a legal battle between the Texas Attorney General and the ACLU.
“The Trump administration’s action is shocking,” said Brigitte Amiri, an ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project senior staff attorney said in an organization statement. “A young woman is essentially being held hostage and forced by federal officials to continue a pregnancy against her will.”
An important detail — the minor woman in question went through the proper channels to get legal permission for the procedure according to state guidelines. She successfully petitioned for a judicial waver that should have allowed her to get an abortion without parental consent, but federal officials refused to transport her to the clinic.
She’s not the only one. The ACLU also described the plight of other minor immigrant women fighting the feds for bodily autonomy. The motion for preliminary injunction describes attempts by not only Homeland Security employees but ORR Director Scott Lloyd himself to talk young women out of their decisions to terminate their pregnancies, and to force them to go to religiously-affiliated crisis pregnancy centers.
As for Texas’ argument in this case, Attorney General Ken Paxton made this argument in his brief (the case will be heard this week):
“No federal court has ever declared that unlawfully-present aliens with no substantial ties to this country have a constitutional right to abortion on demand. If ‘Doe’ prevails in this case, the ruling will create a right to abortion for anyone on earth who enters the U.S. illegally. And with that right, countless others undoubtedly would follow. Texas must not become a sanctuary state for abortions.”
Meanwhile, more young women than ever are being rounded by a newly beefed up ICE after President Trump rolled back protections for the children of undocumented immigrants. As Ms. Amiri put it, “Nationally, the federal government is obstructing young immigrant women’s access to abortion. It’s blatantly unconstitutional, not to mention unconscionable.”",abortion
https://www.elitedaily.com/p/why-do-women-get-abortions-after-20-weeks-republicans-should-listen-2806696,Why Do Women Get Abortions After 20 Weeks? Republicans Should Listen,"Rachel Goldberg and her husband were told her blood work was fine at 16 weeks of pregnancy in 2015. This was her first pregnancy, so she didn't think anything of it when the tech asked about the blood work results during her 20-week ultrasound. She and her husband were just excited to get the pictures so they could tell their friends about the pregnancy. Then the tech called the doctor in, who told Rachel she was seeing abnormalities in the fetus and referred her to a specialist.
""I just remember just kind of staring at her, because I really just don’t remember having any cohesive thoughts; I just didn’t know what that meant,"" Rachel says in an interview with Elite Daily.
After seeing a specialist for an intensive ultrasound and an amniocentesis, Rachel was told her baby wasn't developing properly.
""Our doctor said that he wasn’t sure [the baby] would survive, and [the doctor] wasn’t sure that even if he did survive that one of the surgeries he would need wouldn’t kill him, and even if he did survive birth and then multiple surgeries, he wasn’t sure if all of his organs would be connected or what kind of quality of life he would have or anything like that,"" she says.
""It became very obvious that even if [the baby] lived, he would clearly suffer, and the only reason we would continue the pregnancy is because we really wanted a baby, not because he would have a good quality of life. We decided that we really couldn’t ask him to suffer for our needs.""
Meanwhile, the pregnancy was high-risk to Rachel's own medical safety.
""I didn’t want my husband to lose his child and his wife on the same day, so we decided to get an abortion,"" she says.
These are the decisions Republicans in Congress are trying to prevent.
Washington Post on YouTube
This week, House Republicans proposed and passed a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. A similar bill is now in the Senate. It does not look like the Senate will be able to pass it — it would need 60 votes to pass, and there are only 52 Republicans in the Senate. Senators are expected to vote largely along party lines.
But the message the proposal sends is clear, and it's harmful, and it's cruel.
""What does that say to the average American at home?"" asks Dr. Jennifer Conti, a clinical assistant professor in obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, in an interview with Elite Daily. ""To someone who doesn't work with these women and see what it’s actually like in real life … this is really deceiving.""
The Republicans are calling their bill the ""Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,"" arguing that fetuses after 20 weeks' gestation can feel pain. This is a myth as actual research, such as a report from the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association, shows. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also notes that science does not support the fetal pain argument.
""In reality, it’s not based in science, and that’s really misleading to the American public,"" Conti says.
The House Republicans aren't doing this because of reality. They're doing this to push an anti-abortion agenda in any way possible.
The reality is that only 1.3 percent of all abortions in the United States happen after 21 weeks' gestation, according to the Center for Disease Control's latest report from 2013.
Throughout pregnancy, a woman must be able to make decisions best for her circumstances, without politicians interfering. #NoAbortionBan
— All* Above All (@AllAboveAll) October 2, 2017
""They're happening for a variety of reason that oftentimes are emotionally charged or medically complicated,"" Conti says.
""The most common reason I see is for genetic or fetal abnormalities,"" Dr. Anuj Khattar, a family medicine specialist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, tells me. This includes fetuses that are missing a brain or internal organs as well as those with cardiac abnormalities and lethal genetic issues. ""Oftentimes [these issues are] not discovered until those ultrasounds that occur around 18-21 weeks.""
There are also social reasons why a woman would seek an abortion after 20 weeks. Khattar had a patient a few weeks ago, for instance, who wasn't able to get to a clinic because she was in an abusive relationship and her boyfriend wouldn't let her go. She was finally able to see Khattar for a procedure after her boyfriend was put in jail. She was past 20 weeks.
According to Khattar, there have been patients who lost their job and health insurance, there are patients who didn't know they were pregnant, and there are patients using substances who realized they were not in a place to be a parent.
Then you have to consider the legal blockades. States across the country have been passing laws to make it more difficult for women to obtain the medical procedure of an abortion — making it more time-consuming, further away, more expensive, and so forth. After anti-abortion laws were passed in Texas, for instance, women in Dallas were delayed as long as 20 days for an initial consultation in 2015, according to a report by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project.
""Our society isn’t really created with people to have the best access to health care, and unfortunately people get delayed in ways you don’t want or expect,"" Khattar says.
Rachel and her husband were blocked by laws as well.
She didn't meet the requirements for an exception to get an abortion after 20 weeks under Missouri law, where they lived. So they had to drive to Colorado for the procedure. The doctor they saw there — one of the few in America who provides abortion at that point in a pregnancy — wasn't in her insurance network, and her insurance company refused to cover the cost of the procedure, which was $10,000. Rachel and her husband had to take out a loan to pay for it.
""I have a place of privilege, I come from a middle class family, I’m white, I’m able to get a bank loan, my husband and I work, and it was hard enough for us to obtain an abortion when we needed one,"" she says. ""I can't imagine what it would be like for people who don’t have those resources.""
Rachel chose to tell her story when Missouri started debating a ban on abortions after Down syndrome diagnoses. She has testified to state legislature about her experience and shared her story with the 1 in 3 Campaign. That proposal made her angry, just as the GOP's current federal proposal makes her angry.
""Abortions done this late in pregnancy are for severe medical reasons, or because the mother couldn’t raise the money in time to get an early abortion, or there’s domestic violence, or things like that going on,"" she says. ""To use these kinds of abortions to score points is just ridiculous.""
There is a happy ending here: Rachel gave birth to a boy in August.
""My living son would not be here if I wasn’t able to have an abortion, and I probably wouldn’t be here if I didn’t have that choice,"" she says. ""It’s just frustrating that my health care is being used as a political weapon, and that’s all it is.""",abortion

Just this week alone, President Trump wisely pulled America out of the economy crippling Paris Accord, which would have done nothing to affect the climate, but killed countless jobs in the U.S.
Then, Wednesday gifted us another shocker!
We now find that NASA just revealed the results of a thorough study on West Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier, which was originally thought to be bleeding off ice at an alarming rate. Had other more aggressive models been accurate, the world’s sea levels would have risen by 1%, a significant margin from a global perspective.
A NASA Study Shows Thwaites Glacier’s Ice Loss May Not Progress as Quickly as Thought
The melt rate of West Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier is an important concern, because this glacier alone is currently responsible for about 1 percent of global sea level rise. A new NASA study finds that Thwaites’ ice loss will continue, but not quite as rapidly as previous studies have estimated.
The new study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, finds that numerical models used in previous studies have overestimated how rapidly ocean water is able to melt the glacier from below, leading them to overestimate the glacier’s total ice loss over the next 50 years by about 7 percent.
Thwaites Glacier covers an area nearly as large as the state of Washington (70,000 square miles, or 182,000 square kilometers). Satellite measurements show that its rate of ice loss has doubled since the 1990s. The glacier has the potential to add several inches to global sea levels.
The new study is led by Helene Seroussi, a scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. It is the first to combine two computer models, one of the Antarctic ice sheet and one of the Southern Ocean, in such a way that the models interact and evolve together throughout an experiment — creating what scientists call a coupled model.
Previous modeling studies of the glacier used only an ice sheet model, with the effects of the ocean specified beforehand and unchanging.
This is where the dishonesty is exposed. The global warming disciples will design models which favor results supporting their world view.
Seroussi and colleagues at JPL and the University of California at Irvine (UCI) used an ocean model developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge with an ice sheet model developed at JPL and UCI. They used data from NASA’s Operation Icebridge and other airborne and satellite observations, both to set up the numerical model simulations and to check how well the models reproduced observed changes.
Glaciers have beds just as rivers do, and most glacier beds slope downhill in the same direction the glacier is flowing, as a riverbed does. Thwaites Glacier’s bed does the opposite: it slopes uphill in the direction of flow. The bedrock under the glacier’s ocean front is higher than bedrock farther inland, which has been pushed down over the millennia by its heavy burden of ice.
Thwaites has lost so much ice that it floats where it used to be attached to bedrock. That has opened a passageway underneath the glacier where ocean water can seep in.
In this part of Antarctica, the warm, salty, deep ocean current that circles the continent comes near land, and warm water can flow onto the continental shelf. This warm seawater now seeps beneath Thwaites Glacier, melting it from below.
As the glacier continues to melt, grow thinner and float off bedrock farther and farther inland, new cavities will continue to open up. Because the bedrock slopes downhill, there’s no natural barrier to stop this process. Earlier modeling studies assumed that water in the new cavities would continue to melt the glacial underside at the same rate that it’s melting now.
Seroussi’s coupled model found that water circulation is more restricted in these narrow spaces, and as a result, the water will melt the ice more slowly than previously thought.
Seroussi noted that critical factors affecting Thwaites, such as how nearby ocean temperatures will change, are still unknown and represented by different scenarios in different studies. However, “Our results shift the estimates for sea level rise to smaller numbers regardless of the scenario,” she said.
The study is titled “Continued retreat of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, controlled by bed topography and ocean circulation.”
Pay Attention To How They Fudge Their Research
The dirty tricks of this Climate Change crowd have been exposed a long time ago, but we need to be reminded how dishonest they truly are, & how far they will go to gain control of our money to do whatever their dark hearts desire.
They will create a computer model designed to predict the absolute worst outcome for our climate, regardless of how inaccurate it will turn out to be.
So, we must turn the whole paradigm around on them & use wisdom of the ages to confound these fools. The most accurate way to predict the future, is to study the past. Look at all the climate patterns occurring throughout history, & use that to understand what’s next. They try to tell us that men’s activities are altering the patterns, but the numbers are not backing their claims.
We are finding, our planet is acting precisely the way it has been since men observed weather. Nothing that mankind is doing now will change this.
If volcanoes, which affect climate much more than men, cannot change Earth’s climate patterns or long term intensities, then we are powerless to compete with the world’s climactic clockwork…",climate
http://www.dcclothesline.com/2018/04/30/climate-change-hoax-starting-to-crumble-as-scientists-admit-doom-projections-were-totally-wrong/,“Climate change” hoax starting to crumble as scientists admit doom projections were totally wrong,"(Natural News) Climate change has been presented as an irrefutable fact; a happening that cannot be ignored, with even the slightest change in weather being named a harbinger of imminent disaster. But the truth is that the notion of global warming has always been up for debate — and new science continues to show that the world may not be ending, after all.
Despite what the climate change alarmists want you to believe, recent research has shown that climate change predictions have been wildly overstated. In fact, climatologists now say that the impact of human activity on climate is 45 percent less severe than expected.
The research was carried out by U.S.-based climatologist Judith Curry and mathematician Nick Lewis, who hails from the United Kingdom. The duo analyzed climate data from the mid-19th century, all the way up through the year 2016, measuring the effects of greenhouse gasses and other purported drivers of climate change along the way.
Climate models found to be wildly inaccurate
What they found was shocking: Simulations carried out by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were way off. According to Curry and Lewis, these predictions overestimate the future impact of “climate change” by between 30 and 45 percent.
“Our results imply that, for any future emissions scenario, future warming is likely to be substantially lower than the central computer model-simulated level projected by the IPCC, and highly unlikely to exceed that level,” Lewis commented.
Lewis and Curry’s predictions estimate a temperature rise of no more than 1.66C; the U.N.’s estimate is nearly double that at 3.1C. More, reports indicate that these predictions laid out by the U.N. aren’t even consistent with the weather in real life.

For many Natural News readers, the idea that climate change propagandists are wrong is nothing new; the founder and director of CWC Labs, Mike Adams, revealed in 2017 that so-called climate scientists had actually been faking their data. As Adams reported, a review of global warming data showed that “scientists” had been altering the recorded surface temperatures to show warming when there was, in fact, none to report.
And it’s not just temperature data that’s been tampered with: Other reports have shown that tidal gauge data has also been wrongfully “adjusted” to fit the climate change narrative.
The Health Ranger has reported on scientific fraud regarding climate change many times, noting that carbon dioxide is not only essential for life on this planet — but that CO2 levels on Earth have been many, many times higher than they are now in the past, and life has still managed to thrive.
As Adams contends:
The problem with the global warming narrative, of course, is that it contradicted the scientific evidence which clearly showed the Earth wasn’t warming as had been frighteningly predicted by apocalyptic global warming alarmists. So they changed the narrative to “climate change,” which is now recognized as one of the most stupid-headed science fails of all time, given that Earth’s climate has always demonstrated rapid change, long before modern humans arrived on the scene. Perhaps that’s why over 31,000 scientists now say global warming is a complete hoax.
All real evidence points towards one thing: Global warming, as we’ve come to know it, seems to be a complete and total sham. Not only have proponents of so-called climate change been caught red-handed manipulating (or flat-out changing) data to fit their agenda — the true data show that the apocalyptic-sized predictions propagated by climate alarmists aren’t even based on reality.

by Peter T. Spooner, UCL
As we’ve set out in a new study in Nature, the weakening of this ocean circulation system may have begun naturally but is probably being continued by climate change related to greenhouse gas emissions.
This circulation is a key player in the Earth’s climate system and a large or abrupt slowdown could have global repercussions.
It could cause sea levels on the US east coast to rise, alter European weather patterns or rain patterns more globally, and hurt marine wildlife.
We know that at the end of the last major ice age, rapid fluctuations in the circulation led to extreme climate shifts on a global scale.
An exaggerated (but terrifying) example of such a sudden event was portrayed in the 2004 blockbuster film The Day After Tomorrow.
The recent weakening we have found was likely driven by warming in the north Atlantic and the addition of freshwater from increased rainfall and melting ice. It has been predicted many times but, until now, just how much weakening has already occurred has largely remained a mystery.
The extent of the changes we have discovered comes as a surprise to many, including myself, and points to significant changes in the future. The circulation system in question is known as the “Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation” (AMOC). The AMOC is like a giant conveyor belt of water. It transports warm, salty water to the north Atlantic where it gets very cold and sinks.
Once in the deep ocean the water flows back southwards and then all around the world’s oceans. This conveyor belt is one of the most important transporters of heat in the climate system and includes the Gulf Stream, known for keeping western Europe warm. Climate models have consistently predicted that the AMOC will slow down due to greenhouse gas warming and associated changes in the water cycle.
Because of these predictions – and the possibility of abrupt climate changes – scientists have monitored the AMOC since 2004 with instruments strung out across the Atlantic at key locations. But to really test the model predictions and work out how climate change is affecting the conveyor we have needed much longer records.
Looking for patterns
To create these records, our research group – led by University College London’s Dr David Thornalley – used the idea that a change in the AMOC has a unique pattern of impact on the ocean. When the AMOC gets weaker, the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean cools and parts of the western Atlantic get warmer by a specific amount.
We can look for this pattern in past records of ocean temperature to trace what the circulation was like in the past. Another study in the same issue of Nature, led by researchers at the University of Potsdam in Germany, used historical observations of temperature to check the fingerprint. They found that the AMOC had reduced in strength by around 15% since 1950, pointing to the role of human-made greenhouse gas emissions as the primary cause. In our paper, which also forms part of the EU ATLAS project, we found the same fingerprint.
But instead of using historical observations we used our expertise in past climate research to go back much further in time. We did this by combining known records of the remains of tiny marine creatures found in deep-sea mud. Temperature can be worked out by looking at the amounts of different species and the chemical compositions of their skeletons.
We were also able to directly measure the past deep ocean current speeds by looking at the mud itself. Larger grains of mud imply faster currents, while smaller grains mean the currents were weaker. Both techniques point to a weakening of the AMOC since about 1850, again by about 15% to 20%.
Importantly, the modern weakening is very different to anything seen over the last 1,600 years, pointing to a combination of natural and human drivers. The difference in timing of the start of the AMOC weakening in the two studies will require more scientific attention.
Despite this difference, both of the new studies raise important questions regarding whether climate models simulate the historical changes in ocean circulation, and whether we need to revisit some of our future projections. However, each additional long record makes it easier to evaluate how well the models simulate this key element of the climate system.
In fact, evaluating models against these long records may be a crucial step if we hope to accurately predict possible extreme AMOC events and their climate impacts.

This while millions of Americans are on the brink of losing everything that they have – and possibly their lives – as monster Hurricane Irma roars up the west coast of Florida.
I must admit, it’s a new low for even a morally bereft, reprobate war criminal and traitor like McCain.
McCain breaks with Trump: We must address our changing climate https://t.co/1PLa6gw9IE pic.twitter.com/lHzxDrxA2q
— The Hill (@thehill) September 10, 2017
Via The Hill “McCain: ‘We have to understand that the climate may be changing'”:
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Sunday said it’s important to understand the climate may be changing.
“There is things happening with the climate in the world that is unprecedented,” McCain said on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked a question regarding why Republicans act as if climate change is not real.
McCain stressed the importance of nuclear power.
“It’s the cleanest, cheapest, in many ways, source of power,” he said.
“We have to understand that the climate may be changing and we can take commonsense measures which will not harm the American people.”
McCain’s comments come as Hurricane Irma on Sunday begins to hit Florida. The Category 4 hurricane is bringing 130 mph winds and is expected to move up Florida’s west coast.
The day that those who will soon join the ranks of victims are on the edge of being left homeless and broke, it is a despicable time for scoring cheap political points because of a hard on for Trump.
At this very minute, this humble author is among the people in one of those Florida shelters where I sit along with terrified children, weeping women and confused and crying pets as the worst day of our lives awaits.
Most of us may literally have nothing but the clothes on our backs come daylight tomorrow, not that a creepy cancer ridden ghoul like McCain gives a rats ass about them.
It’s all parasitic politics and all the time and the only ones worse are his media enablers who will descend en masses after the danger has passed to feed off the pain of the survivors like the vile buzzards that they are.
This will be the golden opportunity for the climate Nazis who will add the additional insult to the storm’s victims to reboot Obama’s globalist policies that are about to be resurrected.
My personal dislike for this charlatan is well known but today I really hope that the glioblastoma that is eating McCain’s brain works as slowly and painfully as possible before the rotten old prick becomes worm food.

Held at the Pir Mehar Ali Shah – Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi, the seminar was part of a number of activities celebrating World Food Day, to raise awareness about climate change, food insecurity and the importance of agriculture and rural development.
The day’s activities were organised by the university, in collaboration with the Indus Consortium and Oxfam.
The day began with an awareness walk and tree plantation, attended by the university’s pro-vice chancellor, dean, directors, faculty members and students.
Participants also attended a seminar, which included a theatrical performance and a documentary screening.
Students performed a play that aimed to raise awareness about increasing food insecurity, while a short animated film and documentary produced by Oxfam highlighted the resilience of small-holder farmers in the face of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, as well as an increased frequency of flooding and drought.
Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Sarwar N Mirza said the event served as a reminder than Pakistan is an agriculture-based economy.
He said it was encouraging that jointly organised development initiatives by academia and the private sector were moving towards the cumulative agenda of development.
He asked young researchers to take the challenge of quality research and develop a vital link with rural communities, and come up with new climate resilient solutions.
Oxfam in Pakistan programmes director Javeria Afzal said: “Climate change and food insecurity across the world is impacting poor people’s access to healthy and nutritious food.
“In a world of plenty, many are forced to migrate to earn more to feed themselves and their dependents.”

http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/indonesian-young-reformers-use-bicycles-to-inspire-action-on-climate-change/60382.htm,Indonesian young reformers use bicycles to inspire action on climate change,"A young Indonesian pastor has launched a ""cycling for the climate"" initiative, along with other youth in the Protestant Christian Batak Church (HKPB) as part of this year's commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation.
Rev. Daniel Sinaga, cited the Lutheran World Federation watchword ""Creation – not for sale"" adopted at its assembly held once every seven years and held this year during May in Windhoek, Namibia.
This is a call for climate justice in Indonesia which like other forested countries has many tens of thousands of square kilometres of forestland threatened with culling for trade, which can heavily impact climate systems.
A ""cycling for the climate"" initiative, which he launched with other youth in the Protestant Christian Batak Church (HKPB) saw participation grow from five regular bicycle users to 50 in just one year, Lutheran World Federation reports.
Sinaga considers this ""a very good and positive response about the project and the concern of climate change.""
This is also because owning a bicycle is an expensive investment for those taking part, mainly college students of the HKBP theological seminary in Pemantang Siantar city, North Sumatra.
""We aimed for the young people, especially theological seminary students, to inspire them about climate change concerns by using bicycles,"" Sinaga said.
""We hope they will be role models for other young people,"" says the 30-year-old pastor.
The Lutheran World Federation launched the Global Young Reformers Network of which Sinaga is a member in 2014, with the goal to encourage more young people to contribute to the life of LWF churches.
It also meshes with commemorating 500 years of the Reformation in 2017.
Working with bicycle clubs, Sinaga organized bike trips around the city to get people thinking about climate change.
""Everyone joined the one-day campaign. At the end, there were 50 participants who came with their bikes for our campaign 'cycling for the climate',"" he says of the main event, held near the seminary, which has around 600 students.
With a population of almost 260 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country.
The United Nations says that over the last decade energy demand rose at almost five percent annually.
Globally, such statistics have motivated youth to get involved in climate justice. Many look to cycling, rather than means of travel that burn fossil fuels, as a green mode of transportation.",climate

Editorials in the New York Times and Washington Post called Trump’s action “shortsighted” and “self-defeating.” In Europe, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement declaring that the agreement would not be renegotiated, and that “it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.”
Such criticisms, however, have far less to do with the actual issue of climate change, let alone serious measures to halt the warming of the Earth, than they do with the international and domestic conflicts between different factions of the ruling class. Led by Germany, the European powers are using Trump’s pullout from the Paris agreement to bolster a campaign aimed at asserting their independent economic and geostrategic interests amidst a growing transatlantic divide.
Domestically, the criticism of Trump’s actions intersects with deep conflicts within the ruling class, centered on issues of foreign policy. Samantha Gross of the Brookings Institution sounded a general theme when she called the decision a “huge foreign policy blunder” that would undermine the global position of the United States. She worried, “Might China be looking to fill the leadership role that the United States is vacating?”
Climate change is a real threat that requires urgent action. It has been understood since the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 1990 that global warming is a result of carbon emissions (primarily carbon dioxide and methane) into the Earth’s atmosphere from human industrial and agricultural activity. Since then, reports by scientific bodies have expressed the unanimous conclusion that catastrophic consequences can be avoided only through immediate and far-reaching measures.
The problems that were predicted nearly 30 years ago are already manifest. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years on record, going back 136 years, have occurred since 2001. Stronger heat waves and longer droughts have interfered with agricultural production around the world. The Amazon rainforests almost ignited on a mass scale in 1998, 2005 and 2007 due to drier and hotter weather. Sea levels have already begun to rise, caused by the warming of the oceans and the expansion of water that occurs when its temperature increases. This, in turn, has exacerbated the flooding that accompanies hurricanes and typhoons.
Coral bleaching—stress induced on coral by warmer ocean temperatures and higher oceanic acidity—has already killed off nearly half of the Great Barrier Reef, a key part of the planet’s food chain and general ecological balance. Glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland are poised to fall into the ocean, which would immediately raise sea levels and disrupt weather patterns worldwide. Animal species are dying off as habitats are suddenly changed or new diseases, which thrive in the warmer climates, are introduced.
The seriousness of the situation stands out starkly against the measures agreed by the capitalist powers. The Paris agreement, generally preceded with the word “landmark” when mentioned in the media, is, in fact, toothless. It consists of nonbinding promises with the stated goal of keeping the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, slightly more than twice the current level of warming.
At the time of its adoption in 2015, leading climate scientist James Hansen aptly characterized it as a “fraud” and a “fake.” That the Paris agreement has the support of major corporate giants, including energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, says everything about its true character.
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which the Paris agreement replaced, was also inadequate, but it failed because the major capitalist powers, led by the United States, rejected its binding targets. Participating in negotiations in advance of the Paris accord, then-president Barack Obama, who liked to give flowery speeches on the danger of climate change, insisted that the United States could not be legally bound by any new climate agreement.
To seriously address climate change requires a major reorganization of economic life on a global scale. The framework of energy production has to be transitioned from one that uses fossil fuels to one that relies on renewable energy. This, in turn, requires an international effort, involving a massive influx of funding for infrastructure, the development of current technologies and the investigation of new ideas, rather than the squandering of trillions of dollars on war and the self-enrichment of the world’s billionaires.
The technology exists to solve these problems, while at the same time increasing the living standards and quality of life of the world’s population. However, it is not possible to do so within the framework of the capitalist system.
Efforts to address climate change come into conflict with the two basic contradictions of the world capitalist system: the contradiction between a global economy and the division of the world into rival nation-states, and the contradiction between socialized production and the subordination of economic life to the accumulation of private profit.
That humanity has come to the point where its actions have a far-reaching impact on global climate patterns is an expression of the enormous impact of the development of the productive forces. Yet these productive forces remain trapped within an outmoded and irrational socio-economic system. Their further development, on a rational and scientific basis, requires a complete reorganization of social relations.
The same contradictions of the capitalist system that prevent any serious measures to address climate change also produce imperialist war, which threatens the entire planet, and the growth of poverty, unemployment and social inequality. These contradictions are at the same time politically radicalizing workers around the world.
Like every other major problem confronting mankind, climate change is fundamentally a class question. It is the working class that will suffer the brunt of the impact of global warming. It is the working class that is objectively and increasingly defining itself as an international class. It is the working class whose social interests lie in the overthrow of capitalism, the abolition of private ownership of the means of production, and the establishment of an economic system based on the satisfaction of human need, including a safe and heathy environment.
The dangers posed by global warming can be addressed only through a political struggle by the international working class against the anarchic and backward capitalist mode of production. Only in this way can the world’s economy be rationally and scientifically reorganized and an environmental catastrophe averted. In short, the solution to climate change is socialism.

http://www.defenddemocracy.press/climate-change-is-real-says-nobel-prize-winner/,"Climate Change Is Real, Says Nobel Prize Winner","Climate change is real, and it’s happening now. That’s the message delivered by former U.S. energy secretary and Nobel laureate Steven Chu to a packed audience on Nov. 16 at UMass Lowell’s University Crossing.
“There is compelling evidence that Earth’s climate is changing and humans are responsible for it. We only have one chance at correcting it and we have to do it,” said Chu, who was on campus to deliver this year’s Tripathy Endowed Memorial Lecture and receive an honorary doctorate. More than 100 students, faculty and staff were on hand for his talk, “Climate Change and a Path to Clean Energy.”
Each year, a leading scientist and scholar comes to UMass Lowell to present the lecture in memory of Sukant K. Tripathy. The late professor of chemistry was internationally recognized for his research in the area of thin polymer films in electronics and optics. He founded the university’s Center for Advanced Materials and served as provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs.
Prior to his lecture, Chu received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Chancellor Jacquie Moloney for his “lifetime commitment to tackling our world’s energy and climate-change challenges.”
A Planet in Dire Straits
In his talk, Chu presented decades of satellite data that show how human activities are affecting the global climate pattern. “Glacier melting is accelerating and the sea level is rising,” he said.
Chu showed a graph that plots the dramatic increase in carbon dioxide emissions from 1850 to 2011. He said carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere stays in the environment for tens of thousands of years. The sea absorbs most of the excess gases and becomes acidic. “It’s not the yearly emissions we should be concerned about but the cumulative effect,” he noted. “Earth is not going to clean itself [of greenhouse gases] automatically.”
Chu also pointed out a correlation between increasing air pollution in dense urban centers like Beijing and the rising incidence of lung cancer among both smokers and non-smokers. He said air particles from power plant exhaust and cigarette smoke contain carcinogens that cause lung cells to mutate and form malignant tumors. “The incidence of lung cancer is 25 times higher now and poses the biggest health threat in the developed world,” he noted.
The good news, said Chu, is that new technological solutions are being developed in the area of air filtration using HEPA filters and novel techniques that trap particles using electric charge. Advances in renewable energy sources like wind and the sun are also making electricity production cheaper and more commercially viable. For example, he predicts the price of solar-generated electricity will continue to drop from 3 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2020 to 2 cents per kWh by 2035 or 2040.
Research is also being conducted to make batteries last longer and more efficient. Chu expects the price of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles to drop 10 percent from the current levels. Scientists are also developing a new generation of high-capacity batteries based on carbon, silicon and lithium composites.
As the nation’s first scientist to hold a cabinet position, Chu recruited top scientists and engineers to the U.S. Department of Energy during President Obama’s first term and launched several initiatives to support research and innovation in clean, sustainable energy. “It’s the best way to do it, and I hope the next administration will follow the same model,” he said.
Chu shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on cooling and trapping atoms using laser. He joins a distinguished list of Nobel laureates and leaders in materials science research who have delivered the Tripathy lecture at UMass Lowell, including Profs. Alan MacDiarmid and Alan Heeger (co-winners, 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), Wolfgang Ketterle (co-winner, 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics), Robert Grubbs (co-winner, 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry) and Craig Mello (co-winner, 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine).",climate
http://www.defenddemocracy.press/demystifying-the-climate-change-debate/,Demystifying the Climate Change Debate,"President Obama, just a few weeks before leaving office and handing over to his despised (by leftists, ecologists, liberals) successor Donald Trump, made a much publicized gesture of banning drilling for new oil and gas reserves in US waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. His presidency thus ended on a grandiloquent note comparable to the way it had started, when he made equally widely publicized (and in practice totally ignored, by himself) gestures of nuclear disarmament. Left-wing supporters of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) typically criticize this kind of hypocrisy, and indeed the related hypocrisy of “greenwash”, but how many of them appreciate how truly deep the hypocrisy goes?
Does it make any difference to the credibility of established climate policy whether the threat it is supposed to be confronting is the threat of global warming or the threat of a new ice age?
Forty years ago it was the new ice age and not global warming that was at the focus of official (and media) concern.
The “New York Times” of July 18 1970 reported that “The United States and the Soviet Union are mounting large-scale investigations to determine why the Arctic climate is becoming more frigid, why parts of the Arctic sea ice have recently become ominously thicker and whether the extent of that ice cover contributes to the onset of ice ages.” Every major climate organization at that time endorsed the theory of global cooling, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The CIA was also issuing statements along similar lines.
A 1973 newspaper report tells us that “a group of scientists meeting under the auspices of the National Science Foundation have again come up with a warning that the world may be nearing the end of the present inter-glacial period and that the Arctic ice sheet has begun what may prove to be another relentless advance over northern North America and Europe. The 46 scientists who gathered at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, for a symposium on “The End of the Present Interglacial” agreed that there is evidence of an ominous world-wide cooling of temperatures in the past two decades.”
A 1974 report by oceanographer and paleontologist James D. Hays revealed that “the suspicion that winters are simply getting colder is no longer merely a suspicion among climatologists. Over the last 30 years permanent snow on Baffin Island has expanded. Pack ice around Iceland in the winter is increasing and becoming a serious hazard to navigation. Warmth-loving armadillos that migrated northwards into the Midwest in the first half of this century are now retreating southward toward Texas and Oklahoma. Russian crop failures are on the increase.”
“The Canberra Times” of November 1974 reported:“A new ice age could grip the world within the lifetime of present generations. (…) A major (BBC) television documentary shows that international scientists have changed their minds about the speed with which the world’s “weather machine” can change gear. ‘The threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind,’ says science writer Nigel Calder. (…) “Latest studies show that ice ages are much more frequent than scientists once thought – and the next one seems to be overdue. According to one theory, “Toronto, Leningrad and Glasgow ought by now to have disappeared under thick ice sheets.”
Mainstream climate change sceptics interpret retrospective data of this kind as evidence of the perennial fraudulence and/or naivety of “global warming/climate change alarmists”, but another interpretation is possible, and it has been put forward by researcher Dylan Jones: “A constellation of evidence points towards the reality of an ongoing, clandestine, climate modification campaign, originating, at the very least, from the 1970’s, of unprecedented proportions and the utmost audacity and arrogance. Its overarching aim is to convert the Arctic ice into a meltwater, opening it up for its vast resources of oil, gas and minerals and to alter the global climate to one more favourable to the northern temperate zones and less favourable to equatorial and semi-tropical zones. The scientific establishment up to 1975 seemed also to have been concerned that the earth was entering a long-term Ice age. This may have been a genuine concern but may also have been a means of drumming up support.”
In other words the idea that the Arctic was becoming colder (too cold) could have been designed to buttress the idea that it needed a climate modification programme to warm it up.
But there were other ways also to persuade politicians of the necessity for climate modification, other possible approaches and other arguments, and they were duly enlisted. Dr. Edward Teller invited the US Senate’s Preparedness Subcommittee to “imagine, a world … where the (Soviets) can change the rainfall over Russia … and influence the rainfall in our country in an adverse manner.”
Dr. Henry G. Houghton of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shuddered “to think of the consequences of prior Russian discovery of a feasible method of weather control. … Unless we remain ahead of Russia in meteorology research the prospects for international agreements on weather control will be poor indeed. An unfavorable modification of our climate in the guise of a peaceful effort to improve Russia’s climate could seriously weaken our economy and ability to resist.”
A number of specific projects have been proposed to alleviate the harsh Russian climate with attendant benefits to agriculture, navigation, and resource exploitation. These include removal of the Arctic pack ice, damming of the Bering Straits, and diversion of Siberian rivers. These programs clearly might affect the climate of other parts of the world, including the United States and its allies. Even marginal changes in temperature and rainfall could drastically damage agriculture, shipping, and indeed the entire economy. Military operations would also be impacted if the boundaries of pack ice, the ice-free seasons of naval bases, the frequency of obscuring clouds, etc. were altered. Thus climatic changes are clearly potentially grave threats to national security, and have consequent implications for military planning.
The long and short of the story is that industrialists, scientists and others with vested interests in such projects have been looking for ways to warm the Arctic for well over 100 years, beginning in 1877 when Harvard geologist Nathaniel Shaler proposed diverting warm Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean.
In 1962 MIT meteorologist, Harry Wexler proposed 3 schemes for increasing the temperature of the Earth by 1.7°C.
(1) Detonate 10 hydrogen bombs in the Arctic Ocean to send ice crystals into the polar atmosphere
(2) Destroy the ozone layer by using aircraft to spray chlorine or bromine into the stratosphere .
(3) Launch dust particles into equatorial orbit to diffuse light to heat to warm the polar regions.
Wexler’s ideas began to gain traction in the 1970s, at which time nobody “important” was calling him a lunatic. But following his untimely death in the same year the problem of how to warm the planet underwent a reversal. It was now presented as absolutely imperative that ways be found to cool the planet and keep the atmosphere from warming. Bear in mind that the stated goal of the COP21 Climate Change conference in Paris in 2015 was to limit average global temperature rises to 2°C. This would be compatible with Wexler’s 1962 proposals for bringing about a temperature rise of 1.7°C.
CONDENSATION TRAILS
One of the proposed climate modification methods was deployment of aircraft condensation trails.
A juxtaposition of extracts from the following two documentaries casts a light on the ambiguous, indeed contradictory, nature of official statements on the effects of aircraft condensation trails on global temperatures, and on the practical projects extrapolated from those effects.
(From the European Commission)
Air traffic has risen sharply in recent years and the impact of aviation on climate change is causing increasing concern. ‘Emissions are rising by four to five percent year on year, and that is what we are seeing right now. And if year on year you have four to five percent growth in emissions, that means in fifteen years a doubling.’ For the European Commission it’s urgent to act, since aviation, unlike other means of transport, is not taxed on fuel, so there is little incentive for it to cut its CO2 emissions. ‘We cannot continue to be successful in one sector and to neutralize that positive result by developments in other sectors, and aviation is one of the most striking examples.’ The European Commissioner for the Environment wants to see aviation take on its share of the effort to combat climate change. The Commission is therefore proposing to include air transport in the CO2 emissions trading scheme the European Union has pioneered as a means of meeting the Kyoto protocol objectives. ‘In order to tackle this problem in the most cost-efficient way we need to include aviation emissions in our highly successful emissions trading scheme.’ The European Commission sees the emissions trading scheme as the most cost-effective way to control aviation emissions, less expensive than a tax on fuel, for instance. Being in the scheme will push the aviation sector into a new way of thinking that gives as much attention to its environmental performance as to its economic efficiency. Bringing the aviation sector into Europe’s emissions trading scheme is expected to lead to big savings in CO2. emissions from aircraft. By 2020 these savings could be 180 million tons annually, twice the level of greenhouse gases Austria emits each year. With this measure, Europe is taking another vital step towards preventing another global climate disaster.
(And from the BBC)
As aircraft plough through the upper atmosphere, above 26,000 feet, they often leave white, bright trails behind them. These long white tails, called ‘contrails’, are caused by the water and soot from the aircraft’s jet engines. As the hot water and dirt comes out of the engine it hits the air, where it’s about minus forty degrees. It’s an explosive reaction. Natural cirrus cloud sits at about 26,000 feet and reflects some of the sun’s rays back into space, having a cooling effect on the earth beneath. When a condensation trail disperses, it turns into a form of cirrus called ‘contrail cirrus’. More reflective than natural cirrus, it can spread over an area as big as sixty thousand miles (sic!). Now more and more scientists have suggested that this contrail cirrus is affecting the temperature of the planet. After the 911 attacks in New York in 2001, they were given an opportunity to check this theory. Aircraft across the United States were grounded for three whole days. So that’s no contrails for three days. After all the data was analysed there was an increase in temperature. A very slight increase, but an increase all the same. That suggests that contrails cool the planet.
The doctrine that increased carbon dioxide emissions are warming the planet became “official” for media consumption in 1966 when Gordon MacDonald – Chairman of the new ICAS (Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science) Select Panel on Weather and Climate Modification stated: “Carbon dioxide placed in the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution has produced an increase in the average temperature of the lower atmosphere of a few tenths of a degree Fahrenheit.”
If man-made clouds resulting from aircraft emissions contribute to global warming as alleged by the European Commission, is it possible that heating of the atmosphere could be part of an overall scenario for 1) creation or exacerbation of ‘global warming’ 2) subsequent presentation of a ‘solution’ to global warming? According to Dane Wigington of “Geoengineering Watch” aircraft emissions can have the effect both of local cooling and overall warming. Although Dane wishes it to be understood that he has never portrayed climate engineering as an effective or acceptable mitigation for Earth’s life support systems, the local cooling idea fits in with the scenarios of geoengineers. And, as Dylan Jones interestingly points out: “The stated goal of the recent (2015) Climate Change conference in Paris of limiting average global temperature rises to 2°C would seem to be in harmony with Wexler’s proposals to bring about temperature rises of 1.7°C. Perhaps this is the point where official geoengineering future proposals to cool the planet will be brought into play in order to maintain this optimal figure for Arctic Modification and Catastrophe Capitalism.”
The confusion over global warming is perpetuated by the encouragement of a bipolar dispute over the extent to which it is (a) a reality and (b) anthropogenic. Again to quote Dylan Jones: “Both the proponents of anthropogenic global warming and skeptics are funded and controlled in their upper echelons by the same source. Both sides are kept in perpetual conflict and ignorance of this inconvenient truth. Big Oil and the Climate Mafia are one and the same. When they call each other liars they are just being honest. The aim is to impede the public awareness of a warming world and its true causes for as long as possible, transferring the guilt and the cost onto the unsuspecting masses whilst profiting from the consequences of a melting Arctic and worldwide crisis. As catastrophe and carbon taxation looms large, it’s important to recognize that as always, the costs of taxes levied on corporations are passed onto the poor. Wealth is de-distributed up the pyramid.”
Economic analysts who have not involved themselves in the climate debate have made passing remarks that, given the corresponding will, could be elaborated into comprehensive, and politically powerful, critiques and interventions. Yanis Varoufakis for instance, in his “Erratic Marxist” article said: “The best example of neoliberal crassness is the debate on how to deal with climate change. Neoliberals have rushed in to argue that, if anything is to be done, it must take the form of creating a quasi-market for “bads” (e.g. an emissions trading scheme), since only markets “know” how to price goods and bads appropriately.”
Among the “six pillars” in the programme of Varoufakis’ citizens’ organization DiEM25, item 5 “Green Investment” proposes: “Channeling large-scale investment funding to green energy and sustainable practices, securing Europe’s technological sovereignty”.
Is opposition to “neoliberal crassness” a strong enough motivation to enable DiEM25 to overrule the (very real) resistance of the Climate Mafia (including the majority of ecologists not normally identified as mafiosi) to the ideas put forward in the present article? Does DiEM25 at least have the ability unequivocally to oppose emissions trading?
Could J. Marvin Herndon’s conclusion that coal fly ash from coal-burning power stations is a prime ingredient being used in clandestine climate modification programmes be utilized to reinforce the positions of opponents of fossil fuel use for energy generation? So far ecologists (apart from in Cyprus) have proved no more willing than mainstream climate skeptics to examine (or tolerate) Dr. Herndon’s findings.
Leftists, ecologists and liberals face the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency with extreme hostility, portraying the new Republican president (plausibly) as a man under the control of oil and coal lobbies with zero concern for the environmental devastation those lobbies now seem about to perpetuate and accelerate. But the fact remains that the first uncensored public analysis since Trump’s election of some of the factors touched on in this article was hosted by an organization situated squarely in the pro-Trump climate-change-skeptic camp. I am referring to Jim Lee’s paper “Geoengineering, Weather Modification and Weaponizing Nature”, delivered on December 3rd 2016 at Freedom Force International’s 3rd Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. Jim Lee claims to have won over the high-profile climate change skeptic “Lord” Christopher Monckton to his own positions. But Christopher Monckton portrays anthropogenic climate change as an ideological fabrication of the IPCC? Is he likely now to adopt Jim Lee’s position that global warming is an actually existing result, partially or totally, of climate modification? I don’t think so.
To give the last word to Dylan Jones: “Man’s folly would certainly seem to take the form of a blind trust in untrustworthy world leaders, corrupted and compromised by the corporate power structure and its overarching banking oligarchy, together forming a single, psychopathic syndicate.
Does the nature of this folly lie in a blithe disregard towards the crime against the planet carried out by unrestrained burning of fossil fuels, pollution of the atmosphere and water supplies, decimating of forests, and the countless other sins that Big Oil, and implicitly, humanity itself, is guilty of?
Or, does it lie in an ignorance of a stolen march towards the final consolidation of a tyrannical, planetary police state, carried out by the Climate Mafia? One in which a global carbon tax, levied on humanity for its supposed role in anthropogenic global warming (AGM), would form a cornerstone.
The followers of each camp, AGW proponents on one side and skeptics on the other, perpetually rail against one another.
Whoever holds the monopoly on truth holds the monopoly on deceit. What has been achieved finally is the ultimate confidence trick, managing to corral concerned people from all over the world into two camps and turn them against each other.”",climate
http://www.defenddemocracy.press/the-consequences-of-climate-change/,The consequences of climate change,"Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.
Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.
Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.
According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change.
The IPCC predicts that increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others. Net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures increase.
“Taken as a whole,” the IPCC states, “the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.” 1

Turns out that 97% is based on specifically chosen surveys that portray what they want you to think. In reality 30,000 scientists say climate change is definitely a hoax concocted by Democrats such as Al Gore.
Via Truth and Action:
Long ago, Al Gore delivered us “an inconvenient truth” about climate change. Ironically, the most inconvenient thing about it may be that it’s not true at all.
Debunking the “97 percent” lie on top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.
And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.
Watch Here:
There you have it folks. Global warming and climate change equate to liberal BS.",climate
http://ecosalon.com/we-cant-say-climate-change-anymore/,"Sorry, Folks: We Can’t Say ‘Climate Change’ Anymore","When we swapped out the term “global warming” for “climate change,” it was in an effort to be more precise with what exactly was happening with the planet. The same can’t be said for the USDA’s new directive to scrap mention of climate change in favor of “weather extremes.”
This new tendency, uncovered by The Guardian via a series of staff emails at the National Resources Conservation Service, is a clear departure from (correctly) placing blame on humans and the agriculture industry for changes in the world’s climate.
It all began in January, when Jimmy Bramblett, deputy chief for programs at the NRCS, wrote in an email to senior employees, “It has become clear one of the previous administration’s priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely, that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch.”
Just a few weeks after, in mid-February, Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of soil health, listed several terms to be avoided in an email: not only was “climate change” to be replaced by “weather extremes,” but “climate change adaption” was to be swapped out for “resilience to weather extremes” and “reduce greenhouse gases” changed to “build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency.”
Not everyone was happy about the change. One NRCS employee wrote in a July 5 email that they would “prefer to keep the language as is” to maintain the “scientific integrity of the work,” and the NRDC, reporting on these changes, noted that the new euphemisms forced scientists to “lose any reference to a changing climate, greenhouse gases, and carbon pollution (and heat, it appears) and substitute them with fuzzy language that doesn’t convey the urgency of a global environmental, health, and social threat, nor agriculture’s role in it.”
Senators were also reasonably upset about the change, including Michigan Senator Debbie Stabelow, ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee.
“Censoring the agency’s scientists and natural resource professionals as they try to communicate these risks and help producers adapt to a changing climate does a great disservice to the men and women who grow the food, fuel, and fiber that drive our economy, not to mention the agency’s civil servants themselves,” Stabenow wrote to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “This censorship makes the United States less competitive, less food secure, and puts our rural families and their communities at risk.”
Reports of these changes with regard to language concerning climate change drew immediate repudiation from the USDA. Spokesman Tim Murtaugh denied the existence of such a directive, and for now, the NRCS website confirms this, retaining several mentions of climate change.
But this is only the latest way in which governmental talk of climate change has been dumbed down. Mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from government websites including those of the White House, the Department of the Interior, and the EPA. The government also announced in June that it would be withdrawing from the Paris agreement, due to the fact that the climate accord, which has been ratified by 159 parties around the world, is a “bad deal” for the United States.
Whatever we call it, climate change is a reality, as a recently leaked federal report drafted by scientists from 13 federal agencies confirms. The report, run by the New York Times earlier this month, places human activity at the center of these environmental issues, noting that the average temperatures in the United States have risen rapidly and drastically over the past 40 years to such an extent that even if changes are made now, the damage is irreversible.
“It directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited,” reports the Times.
“It’s a fraught situation,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geoscience and international affairs at Princeton University who was not involved in the study. “This is the first case in which an analysis of climate change of this scope has come up in the Trump administration, and scientists will be watching very carefully to see how they handle it.”
Of course, to handle it, we need to be able to talk about it. This is the impetus behind the suit of several government agencies, including the EPA, by the Center for Biological Diversity, in order to force them to release information on the “censoring” of climate change verbiage. According to Center open government attorney Meg Townsend, these modifications are tantamount to “active censorship of science” and “appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community.”

Just a few weeks after, in mid-February, Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of soil health, listed several terms to be avoided in an email: not only was “climate change” to be replaced by “weather extremes,” but “climate change adaption” was to be swapped out for “resilience to weather extremes” and “reduce greenhouse gases” changed to “build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency.”
Not everyone was happy about the change. One NRCS employee wrote in a July 5 email that they would “prefer to keep the language as is” to maintain the “scientific integrity of the work,” and the NRDC, reporting on these changes, noted that the new euphemisms forced scientists to “lose any reference to a changing climate, greenhouse gases, and carbon pollution (and heat, it appears) and substitute them with fuzzy language that doesn’t convey the urgency of a global environmental, health, and social threat, nor agriculture’s role in it.”
Senators were also reasonably upset about the change, including Michigan Senator Debbie Stabelow, ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee.
“Censoring the agency’s scientists and natural resource professionals as they try to communicate these risks and help producers adapt to a changing climate does a great disservice to the men and women who grow the food, fuel, and fiber that drive our economy, not to mention the agency’s civil servants themselves,” Stabenow wrote to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “This censorship makes the United States less competitive, less food secure, and puts our rural families and their communities at risk.”
Reports of these changes with regard to language concerning climate change drew immediate repudiation from the USDA. Spokesman Tim Murtaugh denied the existence of such a directive, and for now, the NRCS website confirms this, retaining several mentions of climate change.
But this is only the latest way in which governmental talk of climate change has been dumbed down. Mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from government websites including those of the White House, the Department of the Interior, and the EPA. The government also announced in June that it would be withdrawing from the Paris agreement, due to the fact that the climate accord, which has been ratified by 159 parties around the world, is a “bad deal” for the United States.
Whatever we call it, climate change is a reality, as a recently leaked federal report drafted by scientists from 13 federal agencies confirms. The report, run by the New York Times earlier this month, places human activity at the center of these environmental issues, noting that the average temperatures in the United States have risen rapidly and drastically over the past 40 years to such an extent that even if changes are made now, the damage is irreversible.
“It directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited,” reports the Times.
“It’s a fraught situation,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geoscience and international affairs at Princeton University who was not involved in the study. “This is the first case in which an analysis of climate change of this scope has come up in the Trump administration, and scientists will be watching very carefully to see how they handle it.”
Of course, to handle it, we need to be able to talk about it. This is the impetus behind the suit of several government agencies, including the EPA, by the Center for Biological Diversity, in order to force them to release information on the “censoring” of climate change verbiage. According to Center open government attorney Meg Townsend, these modifications are tantamount to “active censorship of science” and “appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community.”

http://ecosalon.com/why-cities-are-becoming-climate-change-data-warriors/,The Reason These Cities are Becoming Climate Change Data Warriors,"Since Trump stumbled into the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and related government organizations have become less concerned with climate change and more worried about Trump’s wild, ill-informed wants.
The EPA’s data purge
In late April, the EPA website underwent an extreme update. The organization billed this update as merely a “change” that would help “better represent the new direction the agency is taking,” The Washington Post reports.
One part of the site that vanished challenged statements made by Scott Pruitt, the EPA’s new administrator.
“Another provided detailed information on the previous administration’s Clean Power Plan, including fact sheets about greenhouse gas emissions on the state and local levels and how different demographic groups were affected by such emissions,” the Post adds.
The website overhaul also included the “scrutiny” of a two-decades old page that explained climate change.
On a September 21, 2017 search of the EPA’s site, we could not find any information related to climate change.
How cities are stepping up
Earlier this year Grist recently reported that 14 cities republished deleted EPA information on their municipal websites. Chicago was the first city to repost the information. The city’s officials also posted a cheeky, but all-too-real “Climate Change is Real” guide.
The last city that reportedly posted the EPA’s deleted information was Burlington, Virginia. “Climate change is real, and deleting federal web pages that contain years’ worth of research does not alter this global, scientific consensus,” Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said in a statement regarding the city’s move.
And thankfully, this is not the only way cities across the United States have committed to fighting climate change, Grist adds. Other cities have “pledged to go 100 percent renewable.” And other major cities have joined to help uphold the Paris Agreement’s objectives.
This information is needed
A Washington Post piece reported that people who have questioned some mainstream climate research are on a list of 132 possible candidates for EPA positions on the Science Advisory Board. The board has 47 members. Fifteen members have terms ending in September. This agency is open for public comment until September 28.

http://viralliberty.com/corporate-hypocrisy-reigns-regarding-climate-change-following-trumps-remove-paris-accords/,Corporate hypocrisy reigns regarding climate change following Trump’s remove from Paris Accords,"Last week President Trump announced that the United States was pulling out of the Paris Peace Accords and dispensing with the worldwide farce of trying to counter global warming through the destruction of U.S. productivity. And in response to his announcement, many in corporate America, especially from over in Silicon Valley, publicly crucified the President as being someone who cares little about the environment, and of course, the future of our children.
But the greatest irony in all of this is that these same CEO’s who sought to be holier than thou in blaming Trump for crushing their dream of a green future, are the very same ones who have done little or nothing on their own to lower their carbon footprint, and instead show their great hypocrisy by blaming the government for not funding their liberal green agendas.
The irony of the “green” movement of US companies is that many of the firms that spend the most money and public relations effort trying to show the government, the public, and their shareholders that they are trying to improve the environment are also among the most prolific polluters in the country. Pollution does not mean that the companies are doing anything illegal. Instead, it simply refers to natural consequence of the companies’ industrial efforts which result in contamination to the air, soil or water by the discharge of substances that are toxic to the environment.
24/7 Wall St. has put together a list of the Top Ten Greenwashers in America. There may be some large companies that are greater polluters than these firms. There may be other corporations that do more to promote their pro-environment credentials. But those can be counted on two hands.
1) General Electric (GE)
2) American Electric Power (AEP)
3) ExxonMobil (XOM)
4) DuPont (DU)
5) Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)
6) Waste Management, Inc. (WMI)
7) International Paper (IP)
8) BP (BP)
9) Dow Chemical (DOW)
10) General Motors (GM) – 24/7 Wall Street
Of course we couldn’t write an article on the hypocrisy of the global warming movement without mentioning Hollywood, or perhaps the biggest hypocrite himself in Al Gore.
The bottom line is that domestic and multi-national corporations do not need the U.S. government to implement new regulations on cutting down carbon emissions or to move towards greener forms of alternative energy. And there is nothing stopping corporate America, Wall Street, or Silicon Valley from dipping into their own pockets to create the next green energy source, and the newest technologies that will not only improve life on this planet for the future, but satisfy their agendas to rid the world of that phantom monster called climate change.
But sadly, these paper billionaires never want to spend their own money, and to them if the taxpayers don’t foot the bill, then it must be time for the #hashtags to come out to blame Donald Trump for not falling in line behind their failed political agendas.

Laura Tenenbaum, a former science communicator for NASA, who departed the US space agency in October 2017 after working there for 10 years, said she was restricted in speaking to the media due to her focus on climate change.
She was also warned off using the term ""global warming"" on social media, said the report on 30 May.
""NASA's talking point is that it's business as usual, but that's not true,"" Tenenbaum was quoted as saying.
""They have stopped promoting or emphasising climate science communication, they have minimised it. People inside the agency are concerned Trump will cut climate science funding. There is a fear and anxiety there and the outcome has been chaos,"" she added.
Figures show a notable decline in NASA's output of climate information since the election of the Trump administration.
According to CrowdTangle, a content discovery and social monitoring platform, Nasa posted frequently on its climate change Facebook page during 2016, peaking at 122 posts during August of that year.
NASA posted 53 such Facebook posts in January 2017, the month of Trump's inauguration. They came down to 21 times this March and 31 times in April.
This slide in posts has also resulted in dwindling interactions with the public on Facebook, the report said.
""There was confusion about what to do now we have a president who doesn't believe in climate change. Everyone was scrambling. It was chaos,"" Tenenbaum was quoted as saying.
However, a Nasa spokesman was quoted as saying that there has been ""no policy change about how we communicate our science to the American public"".

http://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals/,Neoliberalism Has Conned Us Into Fighting Climate Change as Individuals,"Would you advise someone to flap towels in a burning house? To bring a flyswatter to a gunfight? Yet the counsel we hear on climate change could scarcely be more out of sync with the nature of the crisis.
The email in my inbox last week offered thirty suggestions to green my office space: use reusable pens, redecorate with light colours, stop using the elevator.
Back at home, done huffing stairs, I could get on with other options: change my lightbulbs, buy local veggies, purchase eco-appliances, put a solar panel on my roof.
And a study released on Thursday claimed it had figured out the single best way to fight climate change: I could swear off ever having a child.
These pervasive exhortations to individual action — in corporate ads, school textbooks, and the campaigns of mainstream environmental groups, especially in the west — seem as natural as the air we breath. But we could hardly be worse-served.
While we busy ourselves greening our personal lives, fossil fuel corporations are rendering these efforts irrelevant. The breakdown of carbon emissions since 1988? A hundred companies alone are responsible for an astonishing 71 percent. You tinker with those pens or that panel; they go on torching the planet.
The freedom of these corporations to pollute – and the fixation on a feeble lifestyle response – is no accident. It is the result of an ideological war, waged over the last forty years, against the possibility of collective action. Devastatingly successful, it is not too late to reverse it.
The political project of neoliberalism, brought to ascendence by Thatcher and Reagan, has pursued two principal objectives. The first has been to dismantle any barriers to the exercise of unaccountable private power. The second had been to erect them to the exercise of any democratic public will.
Its trademark policies of privatization, deregulation, tax cuts and free trade deals: these have liberated corporations to accumulate enormous profits and treat the atmosphere like a sewage dump, and hamstrung our ability, through the instrument of the state, to plan for our collective welfare.
Anything resembling a collective check on corporate power has become a target of the elite: lobbying and corporate donations, hollowing out democracies, have obstructed green policies and kept fossil fuel subsidiesflowing; and the rights of associations like unions, the most effective means for workers to wield power together, have been undercut whenever possible.
At the very moment when climate change demands an unprecedented collective public response, neoliberal ideology stands in the way. Which is why, if we want to bring down emissions fast, we will need to overcome all of its free-market mantras: take railways and utilities and energy grids back into public control; regulate corporations to phase out fossil fuels; and raise taxes to pay for massive investment in climate-ready infrastructure and renewable energy — so that solar panels can go on everyone’s rooftop, not just on those who can afford it.
Neoliberalism has not merely ensured this agenda is politically unrealistic: it has also tried to make it culturally unthinkable. Its celebration of competitive self-interest and hyper-individualism, its stigmatization of compassion and solidarity, has frayed our collective bonds. It has spread, like an insidious anti-social toxin, what Margaret Thatcher preached: “there is no such thing as society.”
Studies show that people who have grown up under this era have indeed become more individualistic and consumerist. Steeped in a culture telling us to think of ourselves as consumers instead of citizens, as self-reliant instead of interdependent, is it any wonder we deal with a systemic issue by turning in droves to ineffectual, individual efforts? We are all Thatcher’s children.
Even before the advent of neoliberalism, the capitalist economy had thrived on people believing that being afflicted by the structural problems of an exploitative system – poverty, joblessness, poor health, lack of fulfillment – was in fact a personal deficiency.
Neoliberalism has taken this internalized self-blame and turbocharged it. It tells you that you should not merely feel guilt and shame if you can’t secure a good job, are deep in debt, and are too stressed or overworked for time with friends. You are now also responsible for bearing the burden of potential ecological collapse.
Of course we need people to consume less and innovate low-carbon alternatives – build sustainable farms, invent battery storages, spread zero-waste methods. But individual choices will most count when the economic system can provide viable, environmental options for everyone—not just an affluent or intrepid few.
If affordable mass transit isn’t available, people will commute with cars. If local organic food is too expensive, they won’t opt out of fossil fuel-intensive super-market chains. If cheap mass produced goods flow endlessly, they will buy and buy and buy. This is the con-job of neoliberalism: to persuade us to address climate change through our pocket-books, rather than through power and politics.
Eco-consumerism may expiate your guilt. But it’s only mass movements that have the power to alter the trajectory of the climate crisis. This requires of us first a resolute mental break from the spell cast by neoliberalism: to stop thinking like individuals.
The good news is that the impulse of humans to come together is inextinguishable – and the collective imagination is already making a political come-back. The climate justice movement is blocking pipelines, forcing the divestment of trillions of dollars, and winning support for 100% clean energy economies in cities and states across the world. New ties are being drawn to Black Lives Matter, immigrant and Indigenous rights, and fights for better wages. On the heels of such movements, political parties seem finally ready to defy neoliberal dogma.
None more so than Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Manifesto spelled out a redistributive project to address climate change: by publicly retooling the economy, and insisting that corporate oligarchs no longer run amok. The notion that the rich should pay their fair share to fund this transformation was considered laughable by the political and media class. Millions disagreed. Society, long said to be departed, is now back with a vengeance.
So grow some carrots and jump on a bike: it will make you happier and healthier. But it is time to stop obsessing with how personally green we live – and start collectively taking on corporate power.",climate
https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/kfile-ken-isaacs-presser-answer/index.html,Trump's pick for top UN migration job gave misleading answers on tweets critical of climate change,"(CNN)Ken Isaacs, the Trump administration's nominee to lead the United Nations migration agency, told reporters Friday that he believes in climate change and said a tweet questioning it was taken out of context.
However, a CNN KFile review of his tweets shows that Isaacs repeatedly and forcefully cast doubt on climate science in the past.
In a news conference at the United Nations Friday, Isaacs, when asked about climate denial in his tweets said, ""The context that I made that -- this is the last time I'm going to comment on the tweets, you know, y'all can ask me questions all day long, but I've done deep in-depth interviews on this. The context of the tweet was a conference that was held in Paris about climate change and terrorism. And I said this will be a joke at the dinner table of ISIS,"" Isaacs said, adding that as head of the Samaritan's Purse relief organization, he had responded to disasters caused by climate change.
Isaacs' comments were in reference to one Facebook post uncovered by the Washington Post in which he referred to the connection between national security and climate change as ""a joke.""
""The meeting in Paris next week is not going to be a rebuke to ISIS. It is going to be a dinner joke, a laughing stock, and a diversion of all the real issues,"" Isaacs wrote.
""I don't deny it,"" Isaacs added Friday on climate change, explaining he met with representatives of South Pacific island countries concerned about rising sea levels.
But those comments are a direct contrast to sentiments he expressed in several tweets and retweets.
A State Department spokesperson declined to comment. Isaacs did not respond to a request for comment.
Isaacs retweeted a post calling climate change ""a hoax"" and an ""idiotic superstition."" Isaacs himself called links between climate change and extreme weather ""a crock"" and raised doubts about scientists predicting rising temperatures.
Isaacs' nomination to head the United Nations' International Organization for Migration has been mired in controversy after reports from the Washington Post and CNN's KFile on his anti-Muslim and climate-denying tweets. He also apologized for those tweets at Friday's news conference.
In June, the IOM's members will hold a vote on Isaacs' appointment. He must receive support of two-thirds of its members to get elected. It has been a longstanding practice for members to elect the US-chosen candidate.
In August 2015, Isaacs shared an article that reported President Barack Obama's climate change agenda as the most important issue on his agenda, along with the caption ""[T]his should scare us all!""
In December 2016, Isaacs retweeted a post about air pollution in China and said that it was the issue people should care about, not climate change, and, ""This foul air will kill millions before #climate ever changes.""
In February 2017, Isaacs shared a tweet from prominent climate change skeptic Steven Goddard and asked him whether the ignorance of experts could be applied to those who believe climate change is influenced by human activity.
In August 2017, Isaacs shared a tweet from Goddard that accused government scientists of lying about the extent to which global warming had melted the polar ice caps and sea ice.
Also in August 2017, Isaacs retweeted an account that said that climate change was ""all a hoax"" going back to the 1970s when some media outlets speculated about a coming ice age. The idea that there was widespread scientific belief in the 1970s about a new ice age is common among climate change skeptics, though in reality scientific concern over global cooling was limited.
In September 2017, Isaacs dismissed scientific concern over climate change because meteorologists weren't able to accurately predict the path of storms, tweeting: ""Scientists can't predict a path of visible storm yet certain of manmade climate change""
Later in September 2017, Isaacs responded to a tweet from Democracy Now!, again criticizing scientists for failing to predict the path of hurricanes yet still raising alarms about climate change, saying: ""A crock! Meteorologists can not even predict the path of a hurricane when they can see the thing and measure it. But scientist (sic) read climate?""
In September 2017, Isaacs shared a Goddard tweet again, which said that ""Global warming is an idiotic superstition, and the people pushing it should be treated as the morons which they are.""",climate

And of course, since he's so smooth, he casually kayaked up to a family watching the event from their home to discuss climate change.

http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/10/climate-change-for-vulnerable-ppl/,Why Climate Change Is an Issue of Social Justice for Vulnerable People,"I’ve never doubted that climate change is happening – or that it’s primarily caused by human actions.
I remember learning about the Earth’s rising temperature in elementary school and how it’s caused by the increasing volume of gases, like carbon dioxide, in our atmosphere. And it terrifies me that even though I learned this over a decade ago, not nearly enough has been done to change or regulate how much of these toxic gases we release.
They are emitted primarily through our use of fossil fuels to produce energy for the household and for industry. They trap heat in the atmosphere, accounting for a number of disastrous effects on the planet that scientists collectively call climate change – effects such as a higher number of extreme weather events (floods, droughts, and hurricanes, for example), melting ice caps that contribute to rising sea levels and less salty seas, and the destruction of habitats that leads to species extinction.
All these effects make it unpleasant – and eventually impossible – for humans and other organisms to live on Earth.
But up until last year, when a study exposed the dangerous levels of lead in the water supply in Flint, Michigan, I never considered any environmental issue a “social justice” issue.
Although the elevated levels of lead in the water supply from the Flint River doesn’t directly cause the warming of the planet, the way Flint’s local government mishandled the situation got me thinking about the winners and losers in this system where the environment is valued only in economic dollar terms.
It also made me think about whether the situation would have been handled differently if Flint wasn’t comprised of majority Black and poor residents.
Human activity within a capitalist society has not been eco-conscious. Governments and large corporations put the Earth’s environment on the backburner in order to cut costs and cut corners for profits. This mindset preserves inequality, de-prioritizes climate change for short-term gains, and causes nonhuman and human suffering.
What’s even sadder is that I don’t have the privilege of always making eco-friendly consumption choices because they are often out of reach on my income, and the products I can afford are often affordable at the expense of the environment and humanity.
I once thought that if I did the right individual actions like recycle properly, remember to conserve electricity, take public transportation, support collective efforts to conserve wildlife, preserve natural spaces, and reduce carbon emissions, that it would be enough. But there is an entire system that deters us from properly caring for the coral reefs, our rivers, and ourselves.
And until we treat climate change as a social issue that is not a separate issue for environmentalists-only or as separate from social justice work, we are not addressing the full issue.
It is easy for many of us to consider our own activist work to be more important, more urgent, and more relevant to the concerns of the immediate generation. But climate change isn’t just a distant or separate problem affecting only future generations (who we do also have a social responsibility to care about). Rather, it’s an issue that has accelerated in severity within our lifetime and directly contributes to injustice in most facets of human life.
Here are three reasons why climate change needs to be framed as a social justice issue when we design policies to stop it.
1. Climate Change Is Caused by the People Who Are the Least Affected By It
There are many ways to measure which countries are most responsible for contributing to climate change, but they all tell us that the biggest contributors to climate change are not the same ones that are most vulnerable to climate change.
Although Small Island Developing States, like islands in the Caribbean, in the Pacific Ocean, and off the coast of Africa and Asia, account for 0.003 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, these islands are at risk of completely disappearing due to rising sea levels, which have already caused displacement of coastal communities.
Carbon dioxide emissions are also often a direct signifier of a country’s economic growth. And these wealthier countries are generally better equipped with the laws and infrastructure to handle weather emergencies, epidemic outbreaks, and climate-related loss of livelihoods that make poorer countries so vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
Countries closer to the equator already experience high heat temperatures closer to our bodies’ biophysical thresholds so that incremental rises in temperature are much more dangerous. Heat also increases the rise in transmission and incidence of airborne and waterborne diseases in the tropics – generating unpayable health costs as the majority of the world’s poorest people do not have health insurance coverage or access to financial products and services.
Climate change has also been correlated with increases in violence and conflict, especially in countries that are ethnically diverse.
In regions that are already unstable, heatwaves and droughts resulting from climate change threaten the supply of food and other resources, exacerbating conflict between already tense or opposing groups of people.
Scientists have also shown a positive relationship between rises in temperature and aggression across many different situations.
In fact, on September 21, the Obama Administration called on US governmental agencies to treat climate change as a threat to national security, recognizing that the effects of climate change “can stress some countries’ ability to provide the conditions necessary for human security. All of these effects can lead to population migration within and across international borders, spur crises, and amplify or accelerate conflict in countries or regions already facing instability and fragility.”
Yet these unequal distributions of negative impact from climate change aren’t very visible to citizens within the United States and other industrialized countries who do not bear the severest brunt of weather pattern changes. Additionally wealth inequality and poverty make it difficult to say no to expanding industries that release so much carbon into the atmosphere.
If we want to fight injustice, we must recognize at just how many levels it operates. We must be aware of just how intertwined our fights against oppression are and the convoluted way in which various forms of discrimination interact in social systems.
Climate change is not only unfair to nonhuman living creatures that have done nothing to cause it, but deeply unfair at the national level to countries with citizens who have to deal with its most acute consequences while receiving none of the profits – and as we’ll see, deeply unfair within already oppressed communities.
2. Climate Change Causes Suffering That Disproportionately Affects People with Less Power",climate
http://uproxx.com/news/white-house-drops-climate-change-national-security-threat/,The White House Will Reportedly Drop Climate Change From The National Security Threat List,"President Trump is set to announce his new (even Russia-friendlier) national security strategy this week. While the strategy’s hard stance toward China is making headlines, another change could have even bigger implications for the future. According to reports, the U.S. will officially remove climate change from the list of national security threats in the doctrine.
In yet another complete shift away from Barack Obama’s policies, the strategy appears like another instance of the Trump administration ignoring the realities of climate change — after a first year in office marked by a number of calamitous natural disasters. From the New York Times:
The document instead places climate under a section on embracing “energy dominance,” and says that while “climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system,” American leadership will be “indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda.”
That puts it at odds with the Pentagon, which has continued to highlight national security threats from a changing climate, including refugee flows as a result of droughts and intensifying storms and the repercussions of rising sea waters.
Climate change was added to the country’s national security strategy doctrine in 2015. The updated doctrine will instead focus on economic competition and securing the nation’s borders as part of Trump’s ongoing “America First” strategy.",climate
http://washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/18/climate-change-removed-from-trump-national-threat-/,"Climate changed: Trump reverses Obama, eliminates climate from list of national security threats","President Trump will announce Monday his new National Security Strategy, putting his own stamp on a defense plan that reverses an Obama administration policy by eliminating climate change from a list of threats to national security.
Senior administration officials said Sunday that Mr. Trump will release the plan Monday afternoon in a speech that outlines his emphasis on protecting American economic power as well as securing the homeland.
Officials briefing reporters Sunday confirmed that Mr. Trump’s national security playbook eliminates climate change as a priority in defense planning.
“Climate change is not identified as a national security threat,” an official said, adding that the position is consistent with Mr. Trump’s decision earlier this year to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord that was signed by President Obama. The official said the importance of “climate and environmental stewardship are discussed” in the plan.
The president’s plan lays out four “vital” national security interests: protecting the homeland and “America’s way of life,” promoting U.S. prosperity, promoting “peace through strength,” and advancing American influence.
“America’s economic security is national security,” the official said. “We will demand fair and reciprocal economic relationships around the world. The economic piece gets much more attention.”
The strategy also affirms the importance to Mr. Trump of alliances such as NATO and the United Nations General Assembly, organizations that have clashed with Mr. Trump’s worldview in the past.
Mr. Obama continually referred to climate change and global warming as one of the biggest threats to U.S. national security and economic prosperity. Mr. Obama made climate change a key part of his National Security Strategy released in 2015, including onerous regulations for addressing global warming.
In September 2016, Mr. Obama issued orders requiring federal agencies to consider the effects of climate change in the development of national security policies.
Mr. Trump’s new plan rejects that outlook, and calls for a balancing of economic and environmental considerations in forging a long-range national security plan.

http://washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/18/climate-change-removed-from-trump-national-threat-,"Climate changed: Trump reverses Obama, eliminates climate from list of national security threats","President Trump will announce Monday his new National Security Strategy, putting his own stamp on a defense plan that reverses an Obama administration policy by eliminating climate change from a list of threats to national security.
Senior administration officials said Sunday that Mr. Trump will release the plan Monday afternoon in a speech that outlines his emphasis on protecting American economic power as well as securing the homeland.
Officials briefing reporters Sunday confirmed that Mr. Trump’s national security playbook eliminates climate change as a priority in defense planning.
“Climate change is not identified as a national security threat,” an official said, adding that the position is consistent with Mr. Trump’s decision earlier this year to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord that was signed by President Obama. The official said the importance of “climate and environmental stewardship are discussed” in the plan.
The president’s plan lays out four “vital” national security interests: protecting the homeland and “America’s way of life,” promoting U.S. prosperity, promoting “peace through strength,” and advancing American influence.
“America’s economic security is national security,” the official said. “We will demand fair and reciprocal economic relationships around the world. The economic piece gets much more attention.”
The strategy also affirms the importance to Mr. Trump of alliances such as NATO and the United Nations General Assembly, organizations that have clashed with Mr. Trump’s worldview in the past.
Mr. Obama continually referred to climate change and global warming as one of the biggest threats to U.S. national security and economic prosperity. Mr. Obama made climate change a key part of his National Security Strategy released in 2015, including onerous regulations for addressing global warming.
In September 2016, Mr. Obama issued orders requiring federal agencies to consider the effects of climate change in the development of national security policies.
Mr. Trump’s new plan rejects that outlook, and calls for a balancing of economic and environmental considerations in forging a long-range national security plan.
“An America that is safe, prosperous, and free at home is an America with the strength, confidence, and will to lead abroad,” the draft of the new strategy states. “U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth, energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests.”

https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/leaked-epa-email-downplay-climate-change/,Report: Leaked EPA email tells employees to ‘downplay’ climate change,"An internal email sent Tuesday night to Environmental Protection Agency employees included “a list of eight approved talking points on climate change” that contradicted widely accepted science on climate change, the Huffington Post reported on Wednesday.
The email was sent on behalf of Joel Scheraga, the senior advisor for climate adaptation, under the subject line “Consistent Messages on Climate Adaptation.”
The memo drew controversy for two main talking points, which blatantly contradict the agency’s own former website on climate science and a federal climate report that had input from EPA scientists.
“Human activity impacts our changing climate in some manner. The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.
While there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on climate change, clear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.”
The talking points echo EPA administrator Scott Pruitt’s efforts to downplay legitimate climate science, including purging the agency’s website of climate change information.
Although the EPA confirmed the email, a spokeswoman for the agency told the Huffington Post that it was not “an official memo” and denied the characterization of its wording.
“Implying we are telling people to downplay climate change is a gross over misrepresentation of the facts,” spokeswoman Liz Bowman said.",climate
http://dailydot.com/layer8/trump-climate-change-national-security/,Trump administration no longer considers climate change a national security threat,"The Trump administration will remove climate change from a list of the United States’ most important national security threats today, according to a new report.
Climate change, which is responsible for rising sea levels and dramatic weather events, was placed on the list of national security threats in 2015 by President Barack Obama, who called it an “urgent and growing threat to our national security.”
The global nature of the concept runs counter to the “America First” nature of the new doctrine, which is focused on ensuring America’s economic exceptionalism through military strength. Trump’s new doctrine will, however, make note of the “importance of environmental stewardship.”
Additionally, Trump’ defense spending bill, which he signed last week, authorizes money for studies to see how U.S. military installations will be impacted by rising seas.
Trump’s new doctrine will also call out “revisionist powers,” naming China and Russia as direct threats to national security.
Climate change, which the majority of scientists believe is caused by man-made factors, is considered by many to be a threat to global stability as resources dwindle in areas and cause mass migration.

http://www.debbieschlussel.com/84818/wonder-woman-long-feminist-anti-american-multiculti-bore/,"Wonder Woman: Long, Feminist, Anti-American, MultiCulti Bore With a Muslim Hero","Don’t let the alleged Lebanese boycott of Wonder Woman or the reason for the boycott–star and former Israeli soldier Gal Gadot–mislead you into thinking the new “Wonder Woman” movie is worthwhile. The flick, in theaters today, is a long, feminist, anti-American, multicultural bore. In fact, the Lebanese should love this film because one of the heroes is Muslim and Americans are painted as an ugly people.
I’m not surprised that mainstream (a/k/a liberal) movie critics are raving over this. They despise strong men and masculinity and so badly want female-driven superheroes to succeed. A female superhero movie has never been a hit, and this one is the first superhero movie directed by a woman. So, they doubly lie in their reviews to make you think it’s good. But it isn’t. Nope. At nearly 2.5 hours, this poorly-edited, clumsy clunker of a movie is even more overstuffed with dumbness and stupidity than Gabourey Sidibe.
More on that later. First, a little you must know about the origins of Wonder Woman–stuff of which most people are ignorant.
When I was a kid, I used to be a big fan of “Wonder Woman,” then starring the beautiful Lynda Carter. But a few years ago, I learned the history of Wonder Woman, and I’ve been debating getting rid of my deflector wrist cuffs. In fact, Wonder Woman was written by a far-left acolyte of Margaret Sanger and early feminism. It’s all about the evils of men and the greatness of lesbians and suffragettes. That patriotic, pro-American stuff that became attached to Wonder Woman was all Hollywood and marketing. WW creator William Moulton Marston once said that he wrote Wonder Woman story lines to show the evils of men–not mankind, but the male gender. “My whole strip is aimed at drawing the distinction in the minds of children and adults between love bonds and male bonds of cruelty and destruction.” Moulton’s only redeeming quality was that he was anti-Nazi. But that hardly made him a great American patriot. Not even close.
As detailed in the 2014 book, “The Secret History of Wonder Woman,” Marston was a Harvard trained psychologist and huckster who supposedly invented one of the first lie detector tests. But he was also a good friend of Planned Parenthood founder and racist/eugenicist Margaret Sanger. And he was close with the early feminist and suffragette movements. Sanger’s niece was a frequent boarder at his home.
Marston based Wonder Woman on Sanger and the feminists. And he also based his famous superhero on the two women in his life and their very liberal and quite depraved–even for today–living and sleeping arrangement at his home. Marston maintained a menage-a-trois with his wife and mistress. First, he cheated on his wife. Then, he told her his mistress was moving in and she could either accept that or leave. So, the three of them lived together, with the women occasionally having a lesbian relationship. Marston had children with both of them.
Yes, this is the guy who invented Wonder Woman and these are the sick women on whom he based the superhero Amazon. Given that, I had to laugh when I read a New York Post column by Maureen Callahan decrying Wonder Woman being “less American than ever.” Clearly, she’s ignorant on the topic. Wonder Woman was never American. She was just the embodiment of some warped, depraved weirdo who was simultaneously an ally of feminist abortionists and a misogynist. Somebody watched too many Lynda Carter reruns and fell for Hollywood’s manufactured patriotism stamped onto a comic character. (The Wonder Woman TV series, by the way, does NOT pass the test of time–if you watch them now, the episodes are downright cheesy. Fun fact: a struggling immigrant wannabe actor, named Richard Springthorpe, twice starred as silly characters on Wonder Woman in 1978 and 1979. He later became Rick Springfield.)
Callahan also claims that the new Wonder Woman movie forgoes the comic book heroine’s traditional fights against the Nazis–and instead takes place during World War I–because Hollywood doesn’t want to offend Europeans, specifically Germans. Not sure where she learned history, but in fact, World War I very closely mirrored World War II in terms of who was fighting whom and who were the good and bad guys. And she clearly didn’t see the movie. Germans are very much the villains in the movie. Male lead Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) repeatedly says the Germans are “the bad guys.” True, the movie takes place during World War I, but the Germans are very much the baddies onscreen. They’re so sinister that the only thing missing is the swastika. The Germans are developing a deadly chemical weapon in Turkey and are shown torturing people to death in testing it. A point of bad research and writing that I caught: the notebook of the creepy female scientist who develops the deadly gases, is written in the Sumerian and Osman languages. But, while the movie takes place during World War I (which ended in 1918), the Osman language was not invented until at least 1920, after the movie takes place. Blunder Woman. (Osman is a Turkish Muslim language created by a close relative of two Turkish sultans.)
The story: Wonder Woman is born Diana, princess of the Amazons (all women), and the movie begins by showing the young girl watching adult Amazons train to fight. All of the actresses playing these women have laughable accents that they go in and out of (I laughed repeatedly at Robin Wright’s). The young Diana alternates between an American accent and something that sounds like a lisp, and then, suddenly, when she grows up, she sounds Israeli. Again, more clumsiness for this movie.
In the first of many scenes of unrealistic male helplessness and female super-strength, Steve Trevor crashes his plane in the ocean off the island where the Amazons live. He can’t extract himself from the wreckage. So Diana leaps in and frees him, saving him. Next, she and the other Amazon women save him from the Germans who come ashore. And later, Diana repeatedly saves a bunch of male boobs, including Trevor from a series of near-death mishaps. It’s tough to watch so much male ineptitude that looks like it was cast and filmed by the non-glorious Glorias (Steinem and Allred). I know this movie is superhero science fiction, but, daaaamn, is it unbelievable. Chris Pine must have mentally chopped his testicles off to play this role. I mean, what the heck happened to them? He definitely tore up his man card. On top of that, he looks so tiny, puny, girlie, and effiminate in this movie, it’s painful to watch. He definitely assumes the role of damsel in distress.
Diana leaves the Amazons forever to come to the UK to help Trevor fight the Germans, whom she believes are the embodiment of the evil god Aries and are working with Aries. Trevor is an American who is assigned to the British to spy on the Germans during World War I. And in order to fight the Germans, Trevor and Wonder Woman, of course, need their band of “heroic” multicultural brothers. There’s a Muslim, Sameer (French Moroccan Muslim actor Said Taghmaoui), who wears his fez through the film. There’s also an American Indian (“the Chief”) in full regalia–braids, leather and bead choker, etc. (How many American Indians who joined the American Expeditionary Forces to fight in WWI, dressed like that? Zero.) And there’s a silly Scotsman in a kilt who seems to shriek inaudible Scottish nonsense non-stop.
I believe the Indian is inserted into this movie merely so anti-American crap can be uttered. An example: Wonder Woman and the others are sitting around a campfire plotting their battle against the Germans. The Indian: “The last time we went to war, my people had everything taken from them.” Wonder Woman: “Who took everything from your people?” The Indian: “His people [pointing to American Steve Trevor].” Hey, maybe this movie should’ve been released on Thanksgiving weekend–ya know, just to pile on against America.
Trevor and Diana and the multiculti guys spend most of the rest of the movie engaging in non-stop fighting and action to stop the Germans and the evil scientist from releasing the poisonous chemical weapons and killing millions of innocent civilians. And the movie is filled with such scintillating dialogue as this from Steve Trevor: “Well, maybe people aren’t always good.” Ya think?
Believe me, I’m making it sound way better than it actually is. The movie is just plain stupid.
I’ve rarely been so bored and looked at my phone repeatedly to calculate how much longer it would be ’til the movie ended. Chick director Patty Jenkins has the same conceitedness afflicting most of superhero movie directors these days. She thinks her bloated crap is too important to cut and makes us slog through it, instead of her making many necessary edits. This thing is almost an hour too long. The movie is so lengthy, so repetitive, and has so much unexciting action. And, again, it’s just not believable–despite the desperation of the feminists to want us to think so (that men are weak and not needed).
***
A brief word on Gal Gadot, the Israeli former soldier who plays Wonder Woman/Diana, and the alleged Arab boycott of her movie. Is there really a boycott? Allegedly, the government of Lebanon–which is dominated by the terrorist group Hezbollah–has banned the film. But, in fact, one Beirut theater is showing it, and posters and billboards have been up for weeks, advertising it–despite the fact that the Lebanese know it stars an Israeli. I guarantee you, the movie is going to run in Lebanon this weekend, and it will be packed with a ton of overheated, repressed Muslim men who pant over this beautiful Jewish Israeli woman but would never admit it to their fellow Arabs and Muslims.
The thing is–while she does not shy away from mentioning her career as an Israeli soldier–Gal Gadot [pronounced, “Gahl Gah-Doat”] is something of an Israeli leftist peacenik. She proudly served as a humanitarian ambassador for the anti-Israel United Nations, which then summarily dumped her. And even after she was cast as Wonder Woman and didn’t need to worry about a paycheck, she gladly starred in and promoted the horribly anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, preposterous “Triple 9” (read my review – it is one of the most blatantly anti-Semitic, anti-Israel movies I’ve ever seen). She and her Wonder Woman should hardly be a cause celebre for the pro-Israel crowd. This is the kind of stuff that should please the Muslims and, yes, Christian Arabs, who hate her. But they never fall in love with useful idiots. They hate them just as much as all other Jews.
Going to see this movie is not a badge of Zionism or support for Israel. It’s just a sign that you have 2.5 hours of your life and ten-bucks-plus that you have nothing else to do with. How sad for you.
TWO MARXES

https://www.dcstatesman.com/ny-times-says-revolution-killed-millions-great-feminism/,The NY Times Says Revolution That Killed Millions Was ‘Great’ For Feminism,"In a recent New York Times opinion piece, one journalist said that a movement that was responsible for killing nearly 45 million people in four years said it was well worth it because it progressed feminism in the end.
Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer for the NYT and she wrote about her grandmother who was a journalist during China’s communist revolution.
Gao wrote of her grandmother “talking with joyous peasants” and about how she helped turn “an anonymous candy salesman into a national labor hero.”
While speaking to her grandmother further it sounds more like she may have been a state propagandist than a reporter.
Gao’s grandmother told her of Mao’s rise to fame with China’s countryside and how a very common summary of the revolution was how horrible it was for most, but sure did help women in China.
“’The Communists did many terrible things,’ my grandmother always says at the end of her reminiscences. ‘But they made women’s lives much better,’ reports Gao.”
According to Gao, school children in China are taught that “the Communists rescued peasant daughters from urban brothels and ushered cloistered wives into factories, liberating them from the oppression of Confucian patriarchy and imperialist threat.”
Gao goes on to say that it is a testament to the Communists Party’s campaign strategy that through their propaganda techniques they were able to show that women were being empowered by displaying them as equal to men in the workforce, while also paying them less and women not even noticing.
The propaganda her grandmother probably helped with made women be able to describe their experiences in exclusively official campaign rhetoric.
“And by inundating society with rhetoric blithely celebrating its achievements, the revolution deprived women of the private language with which they might understand and articulate their personal experiences,’ said Gao.”
This led to the women of China being brainwashed into believing their life was better than it actually was.
“For women in the workplace to adhere to this narrowly defined acceptable female image meant to see, understand and speak about their life not as it was, but as what it ought to be according to the party ideal.”
To this day, older women in China who went through the revolution still uphold Mao’s famous pronouncement on gender equality which was “Women hold up half the sky.” Gao says that her grandmother still talks about this slogan while also mentioning Mao’s downfalls in the same sentence.
Gao also manages to gloss over most of the genocide and human rights abuses that also apparently marked the liberation of women in China too.
While Gao mentions all of the terrible and contradictory things women had to face in Mao’s China, she decides for some reason to end her piece by stating that “For all its flaws, the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big.”
Gao discounts her whole point of women in China being brainwashed by her last paragraph when she essentially says at least some women were allowed to work in factories (more like labor camps) instead of the farms.
What a gain for women!
For all its flaws, the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big https://t.co/Fci82iAPxM

The Argentina government adheres to the scientific truth that human life begins at conception and outright outlaws abortion except for rare cases where the mother is deemed in danger.
According to a report from Crux, some of the ""boob protesters"" attacked buildings and a Catholic church in Pope Francis' native country with tampons and pads covered in red paint, rocks, a Molotov cocktail, feces, inflamed garbage cans, and balloons filled with paint.
“To the Catholic, apostolic, Roman Church, that wants to place itself in our bed, we say that we want to be whores, transvestites and lesbians,"" reportedly chanted the women. “If the pope was a woman, abortion would be law,” they also yelled.
The totally sane feminists also painted the phrases, “death to the pope,” “abort the macho,” and “lesbianize yourself"" on nearby public buildings.
Moreover, the boob protest participants were allowed access to some interesting workshops:
There were 71 workshops for participants, including “Women and feminism,” which focused on taking the patriarchy out of politics, “Women and sexuality,” “Women and lesbianism,” “Women and maternity,” “Women and sexual and reproductive rights,” “Strategies for legal, safe and free abortion,” “Women and disabilities,” “Women in the fight against drug addiction and drug trafficking,” “Women and cannabis,” “Violence, abuse and sexual harassment,” “Femicides,” and “Feminization of poverty.”
As reported by The Daily Wire in March, feminists in Argentina staged an abortion of baby Jesus outside of a Catholic church.

Her cynical and disingenuous victimhood posturing and effective clearing-away of obstacles for violent terrorists are completely mainstream these days. The real outsiders and voices of the oppressed who are fighting against authoritarians who do all they can to silence and discredit them are the foes of jihad.
Hosseini is an energetic purveyor of the “Islamophobia” myth, and has hysterically claimed that “Muslim kids” are being “executed” in the United States. She was instrumental in prevailing upon de Blasio to end legal and necessary surveillance in Muslim communities in New York. She is also a frequent visitor to the Obama White House, and has claimed that the jihad underwear bomber was a CIA agent — part of what she claims is a U.S. war against Islam.
Hosseini is also a practiced exploiter of the “hate” smear against foes of jihad terror and Islamic supremacism, and has never apologized for using the Islamic honor murder of Shaima Alawadi to spread lies about the prevalence of hate crimes against Muslims in America. She is also an enthusiastic supporter of the “Palestinian” jihad against Israel. Given the general support for that jihad among Leftists, and the hard-Left tilt of the de Blasio regime in New York, it is not surprising that her hate-filled endeavors are taxpayer-funded. But it is scandalous nonetheless: a grim sign of the times.
“City gives $500K to activist at center of Palestine-Israel Twitter war,” by Rich Calder, New York Post, April 2, 2016:
City First Lady is handing over more than $500,000 to an Arab-American activist who came under fire for denouncing critics on Twitter as “Zionist trolls.”
The Arab-American Association of New York, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit run by Tahira Hosseini, was selected as one of 14 groups by the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York to receive $6 million over five years to integrate mental-health services into their community programs. McCray oversees the fund.
Tahira Hosseini, a longtime ally and vote-getter for Mayor de Blasio, got into a Twitter war last October with Queens Councilman Rory Lancman, who is Jewish, when she posted a picture of a Palestinian boy clutching rocks in front of Israeli soldiers, labeling it “The definition of courage.”
After Lancman replied, “No, the definition of barbarism,” Hosseini tweeted, “The Zionist trolls are out to play. Bring it. You will never silence me.”…
Recently this past Saturday Tahira Hosseini had sent her controversial tweet stating “Any woman vile enough to vote for the Islamaphobic, and sexist white supremacist that is Donald Trump probably need to be raped before changing their mind.”
It was only a few days after that the Mayor retracted the $10 million dollar funding over the remarks by Hosseini, citing the rhetoric was uncalled for and unrepresentative of the values we had originally set out to support with the funding.

All white males are racist and supremacist just because of being white. Maybe even white liberals are considered supremacists by this stupid article. So what’s the solution? Why white genocide of course, kill all white people, abort them out of existence until there is not a single white person living on this planet.
While this is just some insignificant blog which was created this month, in June 2017, by some whatever Asian woman named Nicole Valentine, it DOES reflect what these leftist nutjobs are planning to do with us. Or maybe this is just some sensational article meant to attract traffic to a newly created blog? Who knows, anyway this is definitely not the way to attract traffic, by calling to mass murder.
Now imagine a white woman calling on all Asian women to kill themselves and their babies until there isn’t a single Asian left in the world. How would that be called we wonder? Progressive feminism! Naaah it would just be called RAY-SI-ZM!
Notice how this Asian changed her name from God knows what “Ching Ming Phui Feng sucki sucki 5 dolla” to a more Westernized “Nicole Valentine”. So she lives here among us, yet she hates us and wants us dead, gone and extinct, probably so she and her people can take over our lands, factories, names, everything, it’s a classical conquering method.
Wanna bet 5 dolla that if you are a white feminist woman who moves to China then start preaching for all Chinese women to “abort all their babies in order to end Asian supremacy” you are not only gonna end up in jail but publicly executed as well? In a normal world she should be immediately detained and deported, or better, she shouldn’t have been here in the first place but perhaps Trump could fix it up.
Whites need to shove their guilt, be more brave and start naming the enemy openly such as calling this vicious creature right here what she is.
This is sick beyond words and it needs to be called out for what it is.
The feminist Medusa Magazine reported:
In a progressive society, it is often white families that stand in the way of equality and justice. Systemic white supremacy depends, first and foremost, on the white family unit. When white conquerors forcefully penetrated the indigenous, egalitarian homeland of the Native peoples of America, they were quick to replicate their white societies, initiating their parasitism by establishing white plantations, headed by white fathers, submissive white mothers, and, most critically, white children, with full dominion over the enslaved and oppressed people of color that were forced to uphold these micro-fiefdoms.
It is no surprise, then, that America’s fascination with the white family unit has gone hand-in-hand with the historical proliferation of white supremacy. After Bacon’s Rebellion, white micro-fieftans thought it necessary to expand the definition of white family to encompass the entirety of white society, so as to coerce the working class to fight amongst itself based on racial lines. Whites are embedded from birth with the sense of common white identity, and this identity conditions them to replicate the white family unit, thus furthering the cycle of white supremacy in America. That is why the white family unit must be destroyed…
…White women: it is time to do your part! Your white children reinforce the white supremacist society that benefits you. If you claim to be progressive, and yet willingly birth white children by your own choice, you are a hypocrite. White women should be encouraged to abort their white children, and to use their freed-up time and resources to assist women of color who have no other choice but to raise their children.

http://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/the-pitfalls-of-radical-feminism/,The Pitfalls of Radical Feminism,"For many socialist feminists, critiquing liberal feminism is easy. Many of us came to socialism from liberalism and have a clear understanding of its limits and flaws.
However, the history and substance of radical feminism is less well known. While the “radical” in radical feminism seems to suggest a politics that socialists would embrace, a closer look reveals an ideology that’s incompatible with socialist feminism. Plagued by a narrow understanding of gendered oppression and a misguided strategy for change, radical feminism ultimately fails to offer women a clear path to liberation.
Radical feminism arose out of second-wave feminism in the 1970s, alongside, but mutually exclusive from, socialist and Marxist feminism. Nonetheless, they share some commonalities. Like socialist feminists, radical feminists take issue with the individualism of liberalism and argue that personal choices and individual achievement are not enough to transform society. And they locate women’s oppression in a broader, societal context.
From the beginning, radical feminists have been especially concerned with sexual and domestic violence, seeing it as fundamental to women’s oppression. Andrea Dworkin, one of the most prominent radical feminists of the 1980s, distinguished herself with her crusade against sexual violence. In one of her most famous speeches, “I Want a 24 Hour Truce During Which There is No Rape,” Dworkin implored men in the audience to try to understand the profound fear of sexual violence that women live with every day.
This commitment to combatting sexual violence — a scourge that hinders all aspects of women’s lives — is admirable. So too is radical feminists’ emphasis on large-scale reform rather than small-scale tweaks.
But the way that radical feminists have gone about enacting change is both troubling and symptomatic of deeper flaws in their ideology.
Their anti-pornography work is emblematic of this. In the 1980s, many radical feminists worked to ban porn, viewing it as inherently misogynistic and violent. Some, like Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon— a radical feminist academic, lawyer, and professor — went to even greater lengths. Joining hands with Christian right-wingers like Edwin Meese, they pushed for a number of local ordinances to stamp out pornography. “Among the many legislators with whom we have worked on the ordinance,” MacKinnon enthused in a 1990 New York Times op-ed, “one is a political conservative. We were honored to work with her.”
Some aspects of pornography are undoubtedly despicable, racist, and violent. But outlawing pornography would do little to address the immediate, material concerns of women involved in the industry. And it makes no sense to work with conservatives to fight women’s oppression. These are the same people who want to restrict women’s access to reproductive health and roll back the already-meager welfare state.
Radical feminists’ anti-porn work throws into sharp relief the dangers of misidentifying the roots of women’s oppression. Relying on the state for censorship, emboldening the carceral apparatus, making alliances with opponents of progressive change — this is where radical feminism’s analysis leads us.
Class and the Origin of Women's Oppression
At the core of radical feminism’s theoretical blunders is its conception of class.
For radical feminists, the two main classes in society are not the working class (who sell their labor power) and capitalists (who exploit them), but men (the oppressors) and women (the oppressed). They call this patriarchy theory.
Radical feminists don’t always acknowledge capitalism, but even when they do, they regard it as a completely separate sphere, siloed off from female oppression. Their ultimate goal is to abolish gender, which they see as inherently hierarchal and oppressive toward women.
While Marxists share this antipathy toward patriarchy, we have a different conception of both class and the roots of women’s oppression. We define class not in gender but in economic terms: a person’s class is determined by their relationship to the means of production and the state. Hillary Clinton and Sheryl Sandberg, for example, reside in much a different class than the female graduate student fighting for unionization or the mother of four working at a fast-food restaurant for minimum wage.
Socialists oppose any and all sexist comments hurled at Clinton, Sandberg, and other elite women. But the fact remains that their interests as capitalists and well-heeled politicians are fundamentally at odds with the interests of the vast majority of society.
Take a recent example: when female hotel workers attempted to unionize a Double Tree Hilton in Cambridge, Massachusetts a couple years ago, they explicitly asked for Sandberg’s support, stating that they were taking her advice to “lean in.” Sandberg refused to back them. And it’s no wonder. Universal “sisterhood” ran up against the concrete interests of capital. Sandberg’s true allegiances came through, loud and clear.
As Marxists, we know the enemy is not men, but the capitalist class — which itself is multi-gendered and multiracial — and that our strategy must reflect this. Women’s oppression is not innate in humans but instead arose at a particular historical and political moment, alongside the development of class society and the nuclear family.
Women’s oppression persists not simply because men hate us, but because of the role we’ve played historically in the nuclear family. While men headed off to work each morning to engage in capitalist production — making cars at the factory, writing legal briefs at the office — women typically engaged in what is known as social reproduction: the biological reproduction of new workers (i.e. having children) and the day-to-day reproduction of workers — doing laundry, feeding the family, getting children ready for school, and so on.
Even in recent decades, as women have entered the paid workforce en masse, they’ve still tended to be saddled with the “second shift,” carrying out social reproduction at home after they return from work.
These tasks are all vital to capitalism. Workers must be fed, clothed, and prepared every day for capitalism to function. But it is in capitalism’s interest for this work to be done for free and in the private sphere.
As a result, socialist feminists argue that the only way we can liberate women is to end class society, once and for all.
Along the way, there are reforms we can and should fight for, like raising the minimum wage, introducing paid maternity leave, and implementing universal child care. Socialist feminists like Sylvia Federici have also advocated “wages for housework,” in order to provide women financial independence and recognize their work in the domestic sphere as labor. Others, like Angela Davis, have proposed socializing these domestic tasks to remove the uneven and gendered burden from women.
But none of these reforms — much less the overthrow of capitalism — will be won without massive and united social movements. And that’s where the working class comes in. Because of its position in society, the working class as a whole — in all its multi-gendered, multiracial, multigenerational glory — is the societal agent that can fight to radically reform, and ultimately go beyond, capitalism.
Does this end goal include the abolition of gender? Probably! To quote Engels:
That will be answered when a new generation has grown up: a generation of men who never in their lives have known what it is to buy a woman’s surrender with money or any other social instrument of power; a generation of women who have never known what it is to give themselves to a man from any other considerations than real love or to refuse to give themselves to their lover from fear of the economic consequences. When these people are in the world, they will care precious little what anybody today thinks they ought to do; they will make their own practice and their corresponding public opinion about the practice of each individual — and that will be the end of it.
Radical Feminism and Its Exclusions
In recent years, many people’s understanding of radical feminism has been colored by their opinions of TERFs, or trans-exclusionary radical feminists. Not all radical feminists are TERFs. MacKinnon has been an outspoken supporter of trans rights for decades, and has criticized TERFs for their bigotry. “Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman, as far as I’m concerned, is a woman,” she said in a 2015 interview.
But while not synonymous, radical feminism contains many TERFs in its ranks, and its core ideas lend themselves to an exclusion of trans people, especially trans women.
For many radical feminists, it doesn’t matter what gender someone identifies and presents as — it only matters what gender they were assigned at birth. If men are the oppressors and the source of women’s oppression, it follows that those men maintain that oppressive power, even after they transition. Their socialization as men, no matter how short-lived or plagued by gender dysphoria and violence, renders them agents of female oppression. Thus, many radical feminists ban trans people, and particularly trans women, from their politics and organizing spaces.
This exclusion isn’t just bigoted — it’s hypocritical: while radical feminists campaign vigorously against sexual violence, it’s trans women who suffer from disproportionately high rates of sexual and physical violence (particularly trans women of color).
TERFs may argue that trans women do not share a reproductive system with cis women, and thus can’t understand women’s struggles for birth control and against forced sterilization. But then what do they say of solidarity with lesbian women, or cis women who cannot or choose not to have children? The arguments that TERFs put forth are both weak and prejudiced.
Radical feminism is also noticeably silent on the question of racism, and is burdened by a politically suspect strategy for fighting it.
Men of color perpetuate sexism just like white men. But their experience of racism also binds them together with the women of color in their communities. As Sharon Smith writes, “the need to fight alongside men in the fight against racism or in the class struggle [has] made separatist ideas unappealing” for women of color.
Indeed, for many women, the struggle against racism is inextricably linked to the struggle against sexist oppression (both of which are ingrained in capitalism).
The Combahee River Collective, a legendary group of black feminist socialists, embodied this understanding, writing in their 1979 statement: “We need to articulate the real class situation of persons who are not merely raceless, sexless workers, but for whom racial and sexual oppression are significant determinants in their working/economic lives.”
Women cannot reduce their experiences of oppression merely to their gender. Most of us are workers. Many of us are mothers, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and more. We need to understand how all of these things are tied together in order to fight domination in all spheres — and in order to win.
How to Fight Women's Oppression
While radical feminists posit separatism as a political strategy — and for some, the goal — socialist feminists understand that our power lies in our numbers. The division between working-class men and women, between cisgender people and transgender people — these fissures are detrimental to our overall aims. They only make us weaker and our fight against capitalism that much harder.
Socialist feminists’ goal is to build solidarity across the entire working class. Our fates are tied together, and the struggle against gendered oppression is inseparable from the struggle against transphobia, racism, and capitalism more broadly. Any movement or theory of feminism that either explicitly or implicitly excludes trans people, intentionally misgenders them, or perpetuates transphobia has no business being on the Left.
Recently, Left Forum came under fire for including a panel that questioned the legitimacy of transgender people and their need for health care. After much controversy, it was ultimately cancelled — and rightly so. As the movement for transgender rights gains steam, the Left must be forthright in our solidarity with transgender and gender non-conforming people.
While there are things we can find inspiring within radical feminism, such as the emphasis on sexual violence, its analysis of the roots of women’s oppression and resulting ideas about how we should organize politically fall flat.
Rather than seeing men as the core source of women’s oppression, we must identify class society as the culprit. Fighting capitalism remains the only path toward women’s full liberation.

Bruce said actress Rose McGowan, one of the top names accusing Weinstein of sexual assault, was contacted by Bloom through intermediaries and offered money to stifle her story.
McGowan effectively told Bloom “I can’t be bought,” Bruce said, adding that the actress was first offered $1 million and later $6 million to change her tune.
Bruce said the incident occurred just before the New York Times ran with their Weinstein profile.

http://dictionary.com/e/s/feminist-whats-superpower,"I Am A Feminist, What’s Your Superpower?","Intersectionality
The term intersectionality was coined in the 1980s by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, an American civil-rights advocate and a professor of law at Columbia Law School, where she also is director and founder of the Law School’s Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies.
Intersectional feminism is ""the understanding of how women’s overlapping identities —including race, class, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation— impact the way they experience oppression and discrimination."" Crenshaw explains that, “the way we imagine discrimination or disempowerment often is more complicated for people who are subjected to multiple forms of exclusion. The good news is that intersectionality provides us a way to see it.”
And, of course, a way for us to discuss how we can promote inclusion.
The term heteronormative runs counter to modern feminism. It’s the belief that we are either male or female, and heterosexuality is the only normal and natural expression of sexuality. Feminists use the term when discussing—and protesting against—pigeonholing into defined and “natural” roles.
The term was popularized in the early 90s by queer-theory expert Michael Warner in his book Fear of a Queer Planet. It’s a portmanteau of hetero, meaning ""opposite,"" and normativity, meaning ""a system of normative assumptions.""
The insult factor that comes with the slew of man- words created from the feminist movement shouldn't distract from the true mission of equal rights. These man- words are also calls for attention to the ways men have and can demean women.
Mansplaining, a portmanteau of man and explaining, describes the condescending or sexist way men explain things to women. In 2008, Rebecca Solnit wrote an essay in the Los Angeles Times in which she described this situation without naming it. But, other women recognized it and began using this term and others.
Manterrupting is the unnecessary interruption of a woman by a man–and taking credit for a woman’s idea.
And, manspreading is when men sit on buses and subways with their legs spread wide apart to accommodate their . . . man parts.
Whether you agree with the usage of these terms or not, they have become pretty mainstream (yes, some are even in the dictionary!). See the next term to understand how man-bashing can cross a line though.
Misandry is ""the hatred, dislike, or distrust of men."" It comes from the Greek misos meaning ""hatred"" and andros meaning ""of or belonging to a man."" The term is akin to the original sense of misogyny, which is ""the hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women.""
Why is misandry considered a modern feminist term? Because women need to be careful that male-bashing doesn’t go too far. It’s one thing to call out men when they behave badly, but sweeping condemnations and generalizations should not be lobbied against all men. Oftentimes misandry backfires and creates hostility toward women, as well.
The term transmisogyny was coined in 2007 by Julia Serano in her book Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity. It means ""the discrimination or prejudice against transgender women.""
The word is an intersection of two types of oppression that transgender women are subjected to: transphobia and misogyny. Feminists use this term to call specific attention to discrimination against trans women, which often results in sexual assault or domestic violence.
Cisgender, or just cis, is a term for a person whose gender identity corresponds with their biological sex assigned at birth. It’s the opposite of transgender. German sexologist Volkmar Sigusch used the term in his 1998 essay “The Neosexual Revolution.”
Feminists object to this term because they see it as validating the notion that there are only two genders correlating with two sexes, just male and female. It doesn't embrace the LGBTQ community (a community feminists fight for and support!).
Privilege refers to a set of advantages enjoyed by a majority group. Historically, feminism catered to white, straight, cisgender women. But, today's feminists often remind us to “check your privilege.”
In other words, women of privilege must think about sexual inequality beyond their own experiences and understand how it affects women of color and LGBT women, as well. Feminism isn't exclusive.
The term male gaze was coined in 1975 by feminist film critic Laura Mulvey in her essay “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.” It means depicting the world and women in visual arts and literature from a heterosexual point of view, in which women are seen as objects for male pleasure.
Feminists view male gaze in three ways: how men look at women, how women look at themselves, and how women look at other women. Male gaze reinforces stereotypes and causes unnecessary competition and criticism. But, there’s hope of breaking through these stereotypes as women directors and writers make inroads in Hollywood.
The 2009 book Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape, by Jaclyn Friedman and Jessica Valenti, inspired the “No Means No” campaign against date rape, particularly on college campuses.
In 2015, California became the first state to require that all high-school health education classes give lessons on affirmative consent, which includes explaining that someone who is drunk or asleep cannot grant consent. In 2015, New York passed a similar bill called “Enough Is Enough.”
Still, Harvard law professor Janet Halley and other feminists caution against treating sex exclusively as a danger from which women should seek the authorities’ protection. And, male students argue that “victim-centered” policies are biased. This is a debate (and a cause) that will be continued . . . .

Feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It encompasses social, political, and economic equality. A belief is one thing, putting it into practice is another.
Women have fought for equal rights, and, clearly, have made some progress. But, inequality between men and women still exists, and that has given rise to radical feminism, an outgrowth of the 1960s women’s liberation movement. Radical feminists believe inequality stems from patriarchy and that male supremacy must be abolished in economic, legal, social, and political arenas.

http://distractify.com/trending/2017/03/02/Z1AetaY/watson-braless-photos,This Vanity Fair Photo Has People Questioning Emma Watson's Feminism,"There's a nasty, outdated stereotype some people have about feminists: all of them grow their armpit hair out, have shaved heads, and stomp around screaming about how much the patriarchy sucks. Basically, the incorrect idea that feminists are angry, combative people still permeates society, in spite of not being the truth.
Of course, if a woman wants to shave her head and protest gender inequality in the streets, she could totally be a feminist. But someone can be a feminist while still partaking in ""traditional"" standards of femininity, presenting as non-binary, gender non-conforming, or so on. Someone can be a feminist and be quiet, or be loud, be angry, or be calm. Basically, feminism has nothing to do with what you look like, or how you present your gender, and is all about your ideas and belief in equality.
Which is apparently a difficult thing for many people to grasp after Emma Watson's recent Vanity Fair cover photo shoot.
The photo that really got critics up in arms is this one, where she's posing braless while wearing a Burberry shrug.
Granted that little headline above the photo is about as cringeworthy as they come, but is it enough to question whether or not Watson should be taken ""seriously"" as a feminist, as Radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer suggests?

http://enotes.com/homework-help/what-critical-feminist-view-story-an-hour-387252,"What is a critical feminist view of ""The Story of an Hour""?What is a critical feminist view of the story?","This very short story, like many other works by Kate Chopin, has been analyzed in terms of feminist literary criticism despite Chopin never having explicitly considered herself ""a feminist."" Many of her works depict women in unhappy marriages and can be read as critiques of the ways in which marriage as an institution limited and oppressed women in the late 19th century.
In ""The Story of an Hour,"" we find out that Mrs. Mallard, or Louise, has ""heart trouble,"" so when her other relatives learn that her husband has been killed in a railroad accident, they have to be careful how they break the news to her. Louise feels numb and in shock at first, and she goes to her room alone to process the loss. Once she is alone, she notices the beautiful, thriving natural world outside her window, and she begins to feel hopeful. She thinks about how much time she will have for herself now that she has no husband. She whispers to herself, ""Free! Body and soul free!"" She knows that she will mourn when she sees her husband's body at his funeral, and he doesn't seem to have been a ""bad"" husband: there's no evidence he is abusive or unkind. Louise isn't sure she loved him, though. At the end of the story, Louise is very much looking forward to her future as a widow, but as she leaves her room to go downstairs, Brently Mallard opens the door and walks into the house. There was a mistake, and he was not on the train. Louise dies from the shock, and ironically, it is assumed that she died of ""the joy that kills."" The witnesses assume she was so happy to see her husband alive that she died of the shock. Readers know that she is shocked to learn that the future that she had just dreamed of, ""all sorts of days that would be her own,"" will now be impossible.
A critical feminist analysis of this story would focus on the restraints placed upon women by the institution of marriage. A key moment in the story that supports this view reads,
There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.
In a marriage of the late 19th century, the husband would be the one ""to impose [his] will"" on his wife. When Louise thinks that ""A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime,"" the reader sees that the problem lies not with the individuals but with marriage itself. Even if the husband is kind, even if he means well, he still has the power in the relationship. Therefore, the wife is always the lesser party. She always must bend to his will; she must ""live for"" him rather than for herself. A feminist critique shows how marriage does not allow this woman to feel any sense of freedom or individuality. Bringing this inequality between genders to the forefront is one of the main goals of feminist literary criticism.
A critical feminist view of this short story focuses on female oppression in 19th century society and more specifically in marriages of the time. During that time period, women were owned by their husbands and had little to no control over their own lives. Chopin reveals the tragedy of this situation through an intimate exploration of the protagonist as well as the descriptive details of the story.
One indication of the protagonist's oppression is in the first sentence where she is named ""Mrs. Mallard"". Her husband is given a first name, but the protagonist's first name isn't revealed until much later in the story; she is only referred to as the wife of Brently Mallard. Later, as she is processing the ""death"" of her husband, Louise describes marriage as a ""crime"" - ""[a] powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. "" She admits that her husband wasn't really cruel to her, but just the fact that she had a husband stripped her of her identity and will. And then the conclusion of the story hits home the tragedy of Mrs. Mallard's role as a woman when again, the existence of her husband deprives her of life.
The feminist perspective that is expressed in The Story of an Hour, by Kate Chopin is the sense of freedom that Louise Mallard experiences after she is told that her husband has been killed in a train accident.
For a brief period of time, Louise celebrates the glory of being unchained from a controlling husband.",feminism

There are two relevant questions related to answering whether Irving's portrayal of Dame Van Winkle is anti-feminist or not. The first is whether you approach the question as a revisionist critic--taking Irving and the Dame out of context of their time--or as a traditional literary critic, sans revisionism. The second question is whether you wish to examine the Dame and Irving as representing a social viewpoint or as representing a literary viewpoint.
Revisionism in literature refers to the idea of reading and criticizing literature from a perspective of current social and cultural principles and ideologies: ""the reinterpretation of orthodox views"" of literary criticism. Revisionists aim to redirect consideration of literary canon through new avenues of thought, sometimes leading to restructuring of traditional ideas literature. For example, Gerard Carruthers (University of Glasgow) expresses the state of revisionism in Scottish and Irish literature by saying:
...[revisionist critics may see] revisionist interpretation of many Irish and Scottish cultural and literary activists as key players in the construction of a British literary canon. ... all cultural expression is seen to be ultimately sucked to the power centre of a super state.
Anti-feminism in literature refers to overt opposition to feminist ideologies that are said to illuminate patriarchal manipulation and subjugation by males of females as represented in literature. According to sociologist Michael Flood, anti-feminism asserts that social roles are divinely determined and that, as males and females share society, the social order before the advent of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s was the ideal for a dual-gender society.
Having said this, Irving, in context his own society, is actually presenting a literary parody and satire of the male-female role ideology of his time. One concept holding sway was that women were the ""angels"" of hearth and home and were far too delicate in sensibilities and physically to do more than instruct servants in how to run the home and oversee the governess or tutors who educated their children, while giving moral fortitude to their world weary husbands. Irving explodes this stereotype by making Dame Van Winkle robust and domineering in every sense. He also explodes this stereotype by having the sole survivor of Rip's generation be ""an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd."" So, from within his own time, Irving might be considered as having not portray the Dame with anti-feminist leanings.
On the other hand, from a revisionist standpoint, Irving's portrayal of Dame Van Winkle is anti-feminist as he reinforces the ridicule of women as harridans and nags who are irrational and hyper-emotional. Similarly, Irving's reinforcement of this negative stereotype continues when the sole survivor turns out to be a domineering old woman who has outlasted all males through her dogged nagging and terrorizing of good men. From a revisionist view, Irving might be said to definitely portray the Dame with anti-feminist leanings.",feminism
http://enotes.com/topics/we-should-all-be-feminists,We Should All Be Feminists Summary,"We Should All Be Feminists was adapted from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's popular TEDx Talk of the same name. The Talk was first delivered at TEDxEuston, which is held annually in Great Britain and features prominent leaders and thinkers speaking about issues relating to Africa. Adichie's TED Talk argues that ""feminist"" isn't a bad word and that everyone should be feminist. She begins with a brief anecdote about her friend Okoloma, with whom she grew up. Okoloma was a great thinker and enjoyed debating Adichie about anything and everything. One day, during a heated debate, he called Adichie a ""feminist."" She didn't know what the word meant at the time, but understood that it wasn't a compliment. In fact, Okoloma was criticizing her. She never forgot this incident.
Many years later, Adichie published her first novel, Purple Hibiscus. It's about a Nigerian man who, though a public hero, has violent outbursts at home and beats his wife so mercilessly that she finally resorts to poisoning him in order to escape the abuse. When the novel was published, some Nigerian men, all strangers, advised her that she should never call herself a feminist, because feminists are all unhappy and hate men (according to him). This didn't lead Adichie to abandon her feminism. On the contrary, she embraced it, adopting the tongue-in-cheek label of Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men And Who Likes To Wear Lip Gloss And High Heels For Herself And Not For Men (a label that pokes fun at the old stereotypes about feminists). Adichie now refers to herself simply as a feminist, in part to defy these stereotypes.
Adichie then offers another anecdote about her childhood in Nsukka, Nigeria. In primary school, the teacher gave the students a test, promising that the student with the highest score would be given the title of class monitor. Adichie got the highest score, but the title was given to the next highest scorer, a mild-mannered boy. Surprised, Adichie asked why, and the teacher said the title was always going to be awarded to a boy—the teacher had assumed this would be obvious to the students. Sometimes, what Adichie thinks is obvious isn't obvious to others, as when a brilliant male friend of her initially fails to understand that the valet who thanks him for the tip Adichie paid for is being sexist, because he assumes that any money Adichie has must come from a man. This is representative of traditional Nigerian attitudes toward gender and money. Men are presumed to be the breadwinners, and as such men hold all the economic power.

http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/12/unions-are-a-feminist-issue/,4 Critical Reasons Why Unions Are a Feminist Issue,"If you’re not a member of a union, you’re not alone – in the last sixty years, union membership has declined from one in three workers to one in twenty.
The decline is due to a variety of factors (including anti-union policies, trade agreements, and the decline of the manufacturing industry, among other things) and has impacted millions of workers.
But if you haven’t heard of this issue, don’t feel bad – the decrease in union membership hasn’t exactly drawn splashy headlines.
That’s because declining union membership just doesn’t seem like a big deal to most workers who aren’t unionized. White collar workers, for example, rarely need the protections that collective bargaining agreements offer them, and many service workers don’t realize that unionizing is even an option.
However, research has found that a decline in union membership actually hurts all workers. And, like a lot of issues, it disproportionately hurts folks from marginalized communities – like women, people of color, queer and trans people, disabled people, and so on.
Despite big steps in intersectionality in our collective understanding and practice of feminism, labor rights and the strength and safety of unions haven’t been championed especially loudly by feminists. Which is a shame – because the benefit and protection that unions offer workers intersect and overlap with many, many facets of social justice.
Here’s how.
1. Unions Have Been Found to Help Narrow the Wage Gap (And Not Just for White Women)
As feminists, we talk a lot about the gender wage gap – often without being fully intersectional.
When citing the (very well-documented) fact that women are, on average, paid less than men, there is also a tendency to leave out the fact that it’s not as simple as 78 cents on the dollar. Systemic racism, ableism, anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment, transmisogyny, and other oppressive factors mean that many people across intersections are also being paid less than able-bodied white men, and that women of color are particularly vulnerable to unequal wages.
Union membership has been found to narrow both the gender and wage gaps by significant margins.
Analysis from the National Women’s Law Center found that “the wage gap among union members is half the size of the wage gap among non-union workers” and that “female union members earn over $200 per week more than women who are not represented by unions” – and that’s “an increase that represents a larger union premium than men receive.”
Additionally, despite plenty of talk about closing the gender wage gap from President Barack Obama and other top politicians, actual progress in non-unionized work has been slow. However, for union workers, the increase has been swift and noticeable.
The NWLC reports that “the wage gap among union members shrunk by 2.6 cents between 2013 and 2012 (to 9.4 cents from 12.0 cents) – for non-union workers, it was virtually unchanged (18.7 cents in 2013, down 0.5 cents from 19.2 cents in 2012).”
The racial wage gap is also slimmer in union work.
A 2016 report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that not only are Black workers more likely to be represented by a union than any other race, but that their wages are more likely to be competitive.
According to CEPR, “Black union workers on average earn 16.4% higher wages than similar non-union Black workers.” That corroborates earlier findings published in the American Journal of Sociology, wherein the authors referred to organized labor as an “institution vital for its economic inclusion” of Black people.
Unionization’s impact on the LGBTQIA+ wage gap remains a little murkier; while there’s some evidence that collective bargaining may help queer and trans folks achieve more equitable pay, the truth is that it’s an understudied area and one that is worth further analysis.
Unfortunately, unions can’t completely undo systemic forces which result in inequitable wages, but the ability to collectively bargain, coupled with transparency of pay scales and clear expectations of salaries, gives unionized workers a competitive edge when it comes to negotiation – and that can lead to wages which are higher, more reliable, and more equitable.
2. Union Membership Increases Access to Health Care (Which Impacts Marginalized Communities)
In the pursuit of gender equity, access to health care is a frontline defense.
Though it’s often couched as a social issue, access to reproductive care is very much a matter of economic justice. To quote the 1992 Supreme Court decision Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, “the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.”
Of course, reproductive health care needs aren’t specific to women – or any one gender, for that matter. But lack of access to reproductive care definitely does impact lifetime earnings of those who need it.
Planned Parenthood cites the economic impact of access to health care – particularly on the gender wage gap. A factsheet from the provider explains the following:
“Fully one-third of the wage gains women have made since the 1960s are the result of access to oral contraceptives. And while the wage gap between men and women is still significant (particularly for women of color) and must be addressed, access to birth control has helped narrow the gap. The decrease in the gap among 25-49-year-olds between men’s and women’s annual incomes ‘would have been 10% smaller in the 1980s and 30% smaller in the 1990s’ in the absence of widespread legal birth control access.
So it’s significant, then, that union membership is a good indicator of access to health care, generally.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics found in 2013 that 79% of union workers have employer-provided medical benefits – compared to just 50% of non-union workers.",feminism

http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/top-feminist-conspiracies/,The Top 5 Feminist Conspiracies (According to Our Trolls),"Hello, fellow feminist!
I’m so glad you found time in your schedule to read this. As a feminist, I know you must be busy plotting with your BFFs to infiltrate and take down the most popular clique in school.
No, wait. Sorry – I’m thinking of the plot for Mean Girls. Feminism is the one where we’re trying to create equality and justice and empowerment for marginalized people and all that jazz.
Which might really keep you pretty busy. And if your feminism overlaps at any point with your online life, then I’m sure you know a thing or two about what anti-feminist trolls think of you.
They’re impressed! Sure, they may be hurling insults and demonizing the movement, but if you read between the lines, you’ll see that they think we feminists are capable of some incredible things.
How else would we keep up with all of the conspiracies they’re accusing us of? Apparently, they think we’re responsible for everything from plotting against men to using mind control as part of the Illuminati.
They must believe we have an abundance of power, influence, and organizing skills – not to mention the ability to slow down time or something, so we can find the time for all of this elaborate plotting.
But hey, who am I to argue? I’m only an actual feminist, who knows much more about what the movement is up to than the people who spend their time trolling us.
Unfortunately for the trolls, this means that I see right through their accusations.
Some are based on myths and misunderstandings about what feminism stands for. But it’s not hard to detect that many of these conspiracy theories are just excuses to express some outdated, misogynistic ways of thinking.
Trolls can be tiresome, and I use a variety of strategies to deal with them. But when it comes to these hilariously absurd ideas about what feminism is all about, sometimes all I can do is laugh.
On second thought, that’s not my only option. I can also expose them while I’m at it – dig up just how wrong they are about us. And how, behind the alarms they’re setting off about feminist conspiracies, there’s bigotry that’s so obvious, it’s cringe-worthy.
So in case you didn’t get the memo with the latest iteration of The Feminist Agenda According to Trolls, let me catch you up on what you’re supposed to be up to.
Here are some of our most sinister alleged conspiracies – and what it means that anti-feminists are accusing us of these things.
1. Establishing the Supremacy of Women
Well, we’re not being very careful about concealing this plan, are we?
Our perceptive antagonizers picked up on the obvious correlation between the word “feminism” and the term “female supremacy” – and they’ve decided this means we want women to have power over men.
I guess it’s no use arguing with them about it, because no matter how many times we debunk the myth that feminism is about hating men, anti-feminists insist that man-hating is at the top of our priority list.
Which proves that this conspiracy theory isn’t about what feminists are actually doing. These guys could easily find information about the difference between hating patriarchy and hating men.
If they really paid attention, they’d pick up on the fact that we’re striving for liberation for people of all genders, including men – it has nothing to do with elevating one gender over the others.
But they’re willfully ignoring that information to demonize us as hateful people.
And some of them actually interpret gender equity as oppression against men. Which is pretty telling – it’s only people who are used to privilege who think that equality feels like oppression.
I’m starting to think that anti-feminist men who fear women’s supremacy are really just worried about karma. If you’d been treating women like shit, you might be afraid of how a society with women in charge would treat you, too.
2. Taking Away Everyone’s Right to Free Speech
This plan’s going to be a tough one to carry out.
I mean, the right to free speech is pretty well protected, being in the US Consti-freakin’-tution and all, and we have yet to work out the details of how we’re actually going to muzzle people to keep them from saying whatever they want.
But according to our trolls, the fact that a plan is impossible to carry out has never been enough to keep us from attempting it. So, Operation Shut People the Fuck Up is a go.
The manosphere is really concerned about this one. MRAs and other anti-feminists have created blog posts, videos, and more dedicated to warning their fellow men that the feminists are conspiring to make them free to speak no longer.
We’re coming for their rape jokes. We’re coming for their ableism. We’re “censoring” their harassment on our pages, and we’re not even laughing at their “ironic” racism!
THE HORROR.
Sure, we say this is just about encouraging people to be thoughtful about the impact of their words. But the way they see it, before they know it, we’re not going to allow them to say anything at all!
What they don’t know is just how long this conspiracy has been in the making – from the time they were children, when the adults in their lives failed to teach them how to be considerate people.
The rest of us just tagged in at the end here. And how were we supposed to know that telling some people to avoid saying offensive things would leave them with nothing to say at all?
3. Destroying Chivalry – And With It, Basic Human Decency
If there’s one thing that gets you down, it’s men being polite – right, feminists?
Eh, that’s probably not quite right. I’m sure you appreciate men being decent human beings just as much as anyone else.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/05/anti-muslim-microaggressions/,5 Hurtful Microaggressions I’ve Experienced as a Muslim in Feminist Spaces,"Girl power was the first form of solidarity I learned.
It made sense to me when I was younger, and it made sense before 9/11 – before I grew to understand that I would always be the “other.”
My coming of age story may not be like the ones that are portrayed by mainstream media portrays – and this seems to bother people. I wasn’t losing my virginity after prom or drinking in residence. I haven’t dated multiple people. I didn’t have a clubbing phase.
And that’s the way I wanted it.
I thought that was okay – and I thought that my friends, who liked me before we could do all of those things in our late teens and early twenties, would treat me the way they always had.
One thing that I did have in common with many of my during our coming of age was having a feminist awakening – but many of theirs didn’t seem to recognize my ways of being.
This became evident when my Muslim values started to be berated by fellow feminists.
Last December, my Muslim identity – an otheredness that will never change – became strikingly clear when my friend announced that her birthday wouldn’t be “my type of thing” because it involved alcohol. In the group chat where she mentioned it, it felt like I was suddenly a burden, an elephant in the room.
It didn’t matter that the summer before, I had gone to bars with my friends or that my one of our non-Muslim friends also didn’t drink. My “intersectional” feminist friend still felt compelled to make it clear that I was different, even though she knew I could come to the party without complaint.
The older I get, the more the once bright promise of solidarity appears to be a fading illusion.
Feminism, the supposed holy grail of acceptance, is the space in which I often feel the most rejected. And the microaggressions I experience in feminist spaces are an unexpected violence.
In my experience, I find that many feminists think that Muslim women hate themselves – but only because of loaded presumptions about our faith and how we practice it. Often, even supposedly “inclusive” feminist spaces reek of Islamophobic sentiment packaged as feminism.
Muslim women have been put into a subcategory – with our opinions and views silenced or used for political agendas without ever inviting us to the table.
And if I express that some feminists make me uncomfortable, I’m told that my existence makes other feminists feel uncomfortable.
In these instances, women who were the oppressed become the oppressor.
Apparently, it’s fine for me to be a feminist – as long as I avoid discussing how Islamophobic microaggressions are as common as table manners and how feminist events tend to be parties I’m not enthusiastically invited to.
But I can’t do that.
I can’t sit back and let feminists, who are supposed to respect and uplift other women, tell other, more marginalized women they’re “doing it wrong.”
And maybe those aren’t the exact words that they’re using. Maybe they don’t even realize that that’s what they’re suggesting.
But often, the women I seek solidarity with in feminist spaces and organizing end up telling me just that – that I’m not doing feminism right because I’m Muslim – in small ways that add up.
Here are five.
1. Sex Positivity to the Point of Shaming
Feminism is great for a variety of reasons – one of them being bodily autonomy.
This basic principle gets diluted and misconstrued, though, when sex positivity is thrown into the mix.
In many feminist spaces, whether virtual or physical, I encounter instances where sex positivity is a hot topic.
And it should be – because so many have been detrimentally harmed due to shame and stigma attached to sexually autonomous decisions.
But it starts to present a problem when the default expectation is that everyone who is feminist is sexually active.
Women have traditionally been reprimanded for being sexual and taught to avoid all discussions of sexual being. The line between sex positivity and bodily autonomy gets blurred (or completely blown to bits), though, when it doesn’t encompass of a wide spectrum of what sexuality can look like, especially asexuality, and what positivity for that spectrum means.
Notions of sex positive feminism are in need of repair if the presumption is always that being sexually active means being liberated, while abstention from sexual activity means being oppression.
We don’t make decisions in a vacuum, and sex positivity will always look different to different individuals.
There’s an evasive presumption that Muslim women aren’t liberated if they’re not sexually active or public about sexuality. Not being sexually active – whether a decision based in religion or a sexual orientation, like asexuality – should be just as respected a form of bodily autonomy.
Some Muslim women have sex pre-maritally and some do not. And those are the nuances many miss.
There is also a complex history of Muslim women and sex where Muslim women are hypersexualized, but at the same time stripped of their sexuality. And this context is also needed.
Instead, Muslim feminists are either left out of sex-positivity conversation entirely or presumed to revere subservience to men.
At the same time, I’ve also found moments where Muslim women who are sexually active are also left out and treated as either deviant or “not actually Muslim,” while those who choose to withhold information about their sex lives are called “prude.”
Sex positivity doesn’t mean that everyone has to be talking about and having sex – and subsequently shaming anyone not doing either.
As feminists, we can all move forward with integrity if we also make room for the possibility that sexual liberation is found in abstention.
In enthusiastically choosing to engage in consensual sex, there is also an option to enthusiastically not engage for reasons based in beliefs. Conversations around sex positivity can replicate the harm of patriarchy when we isolate people in conversations for their autonomous choices and don’t make space for the wide variation in choices that exist.
2. Not Making Room for Different Priorities
My needs from feminist movements will differ from another person – and that’s because we’re all at different social locations.
And yet, this being seen as a negative (or otherwise difficult) is a recurring dynamic in mainstream feminist spaces.
For example, I may not necessarily want to fight for body hair positivity as much as some other women. I don’t shave regularly, and I’m really hairy.
But discussing that or posting photos of my armpits at their peak hair growth levels aren’t priorities for me, personally. And that’s cool if it’s a priority for some people, which is the beauty of feminism.
I have different concerns that I want to address in my feminist liberation first. My energy is channeled into fighting things related to my identity, like random selections at airports or Islamophobic violence in academia.
Everyone’s feminism is going to look different – and so will their priorities. You can also be passionate about multiple things at once and support a variety of movements.
But some causes more overtly impact embodiment. And because each individual experiences space differently, this can translate into the priorities each person spends their energy on.
I know that my feminist liberation isn’t going to come from celebrating body hair or posting pictures of my nipples.
But I do know that my liberation could stem from being respected as a Muslim woman. And that’s something that currently doesn’t always happen, including in feminist spaces.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/03/feminism-caregiving-disabled/,5 Ways to Let Feminism Guide Your Caregiving for a Disabled Adult,"My name is Creigh. I’m a 25-year-old full time grad student, perpetually sleepy and broke. I’m an introvert, a proud nerd, and the kind of person you might find randomly dancing in the aisles of the grocery store.
I’m also my disabled adult sister’s carer.
People are always shocked to find this out. There are two things that they immediately say when they discover this.
First, they make some pitying remark to the effect of how grateful my sister must be to me.
Let me nip that in the bud right now. My sister does not need to be grateful for me treating her like — well — my sister who I love, much less as a human being.
Her needing assistance does not diminish her value in my life one iota.
End PSA.
The next thing they say is “You’re so young! How could you possibly handle such a big task?”
In reality, I’ve found age has very little to do with caregiving abilities. In fact, to give me some respite, we tried hiring a professional carer to come in a few hours a week to help out.
The carer was in her late sixties. If age and experience were enough to make one a good carer, she would have been.
The thing is, she wasn’t. Not at all.
After a couple of months, when I noticed Caley starting to fear the carer coming by, we stopped using her services.
You see, the key to being a good carer has nothing to do with age, or even experience. Instead, it relies on being able to find solutions to complex problems that respect the caregivee, while not burning out the carer.
These are areas where age, or even experience, aren’t enough to guide you to the right answer. Nor was any of my educational background – degrees in communication sciences and disorders and psychology – helpful.
I stumbled along in the dark, just doing whatever felt right (which was like flipping a coin) for about six months. That is, until I realized I had the key I had been searching for all along: Feminism.
Think about it. The same tools that intersectional feminism teaches us to use when interacting with marginalized groups are perfectly made to cover caring for a disabled adult.
Here, I want to share what I’ve learned, and the sign posts from feminism that you can use to guide your own caregiving for a disabled adult.
Because as I’ve seen from watching other carers, listening to disabled adults, and my own experience, we can (and need!) to do much better as carers. And feminism can lead the way.
1. Listen to Your Caregivee and Be Aware of Your Position of Privilege
If I had to stop at one single point on this list, it would be this one.
Feminism teaches us to seek out and tune into the voices of the marginalized. It’s also a principle that you have to actively apply. I believed in this, I preached this – and yet, I still messed up in applying it to my caregiving. A lot.
My wake-up call came when I realized I was forcing my sister to undergo a medical procedure she was emphatically communicating that she didn’t want. As she was lying there in the bed, panicking, repeating over and over again that she did not want to have the colonoscopy, I kept pushing her to stick with it.
I thought I was helping her. But the truth is, I wasn’t.
It wasn’t until the medical staff at the colonoscopy center took one look at her panic-attacking terrified self and said, “I’m sorry, ma’am, but we don’t perform procedures here when the patient is unwilling,” that I realized what a giant screw up I had made.
I should have listened to my sister. The colonoscopy, though a good idea, wasn’t necessary – more a precautionary measure. And yet, in my position of privilege, I was pushing something on her that she, a competent adult, didn’t want.
As carers, we may be in the driver’s seat for many aspects of our caregivee’s life. And if you let that position go to your head, it’s easy to also selectively listen to them and not listen to their self-advocacy.
It’s also wrong.
Be receptive to what the adult you are caring for is communicating.
This is their life, not ours.
2. Take into Account the Desires of the Marginalized Group
Okay, so listening is all well and good when your caregivee can consistently communicate their needs and wants and is cognitively able to consider the situations they’re making decisions about.
But what about someone who can’t clearly communicate, or who has cognitive differences that make it so they may not understand the situation? What then?
I run into this situation fairly frequently, as do many carers.
My sister’s anxiety is so bad that being presented with a choice is often enough to send her into a panic attack. As a result, she’s rarely able to communicate her desires and requests.
As a result, I make most decisions for her. That’s a weighty position to be in – and one I take seriously.
My first step, of course, is to try to let her use another method to communicate her desires. Instead of asking her for a decision, I’ll just try to figure out her likes and dislikes and go from there.
With someone who cannot clearly communicate through words or signs, it’s important to look at non-verbal signals.
If, when you drive your caregivee to get a haircut, they start banging their head and seem upset, that’s a pretty darned good sign that they’re saying, “No, I don’t want this.”
What about with something that can’t be skipped, like getting an infected tooth removed at the dentist?
Of course, if the person is capable of cognitively understanding the situation, you still listen to what they want, even if it’s going to end with them feeling bad. That’s what an adult who didn’t need a carer would be doing, and making decisions that aren’t necessarily the best long-term are the right of any adult.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/08/microagressions-muslim-women/,5 Microaggressions Muslim Women Face In Feminist Circles And How To Address Them,"The idea of a space where justice is a priority is amazing.
So, when Muslim women like myself enter feminist or social justice-oriented spaces, it is often our hope that these spaces will be amazing. But does it actually pan out that way?
I, for one, have had difficulty finding spaces where I’m not forced to explain myself; where I don’t feel like I’m supposed to be a representative for 1.5 billion people.
I think healthy discussions are great and vital, and I think conversations that make us uncomfortable often give us room to grow.
However, it is important that we start with a foundation that acknowledges the humanity of those in front of us and does not force anyone to prove their humanity.
Given my experiences, I came up with a list to help break down the different ways I’ve experienced microaggressions in feminist circles. I hope this list will broaden your understanding of the (beautiful) human complexity of Muslim women and shed light on how, sometimes, simple thoughts can lead to large gaps in communication and misunderstanding.
1. Having to speak on behalf of ALL Muslim women
“What do you think is important for us to know about the struggles of Muslim women?”
This is a real question that I’ve received multiple times. And while I think it’s important to acknowledge that our religious and political identities are under attack, Muslim women are not a monolith.
We, Muslim women, come from everywhere on this planet. This means we look different, speak different languages, have different religious and social identities, and relate differently to our faith and those around us.
How can I, a light skinned Arab Muslim girl, talk to you about ‘Muslim women’ as a singular experience when I’ve never been a Black Muslim woman? I’ve never experienced the racial violence of being isolated not only from society at large but even from the local masjid.
How can I speak to you of a struggle of an Uyghur ethnic minority woman in China when I know nothing of the unspeakable suppression she faces or how she navigates her faith and womanhood? How can I discuss the way Mexican Muslim women interpret and engage with their faith and culture?
My point in this is to say: because we are living in such a polarizing world, Muslim women in the US are often pressured into being a voice that speaks for too many different experiences. It is a burden we should not be forced to carry.
The next time you want to know how it is being a Muslim woman in an unwelcoming world, ask me about my experience. Ask me what I struggle with or what my biggest battle is. My answer might have nothing to do with my faith identity. Or it could have everything to do with it.
Bottom line, asking one person to speak for an entire community is pressuring, exhausting, and isolating. My experiences are simply mine and I cannot possibly speak for millions of other women.
2. Being told “We should all unite as women against Trump”
Possibly, a lot of readers aren’t thinking about this anymore. However, the recent election season helped to cement the reason why I generally reject Western feminism.
During this time, I was told by several white women that, ‘as women,’ we needed to unite against a ‘greater evil’ and support Hillary Clinton. I was asked to admire her resilience and courage and respect how hard she had fought to come so far in the presidential election.
And yet, I could not understand why I was expected to support someone who endorsed racist domestic and foreign policies.
I will never understand how, for so many people, Hillary’s identity as a woman overrides the white privilege that enabled her to rise to power and, subsequently, make so many people’s lives hell.
Why should I, a brown Muslim woman, be expected to forgive Clinton’s flaws — flaws that resulted in the loss of people’s lives — simply because she’s a woman?
On the campaign trail, Trump talked a lot of despicable talks, but Hillary had already walked a lot of horrifying walks and, yet, so many seemed to forget it.
I did not vote in the election and I told my white feminist colleague that I did not. She asked me if I felt guilty knowing that Trump won. I said, “No, I don’t because my feminism is built on the foundation of my humanity.”
I have had numerous conversations about Hilary’s policies with many white feminists. Each time, I have explained how these policies have directly impacted my community and, still, I was forced to hear just how amazing and brave they thought she was.
And yet, to repeatedly lay out my humanity only to have it dismissed was not shocking. Ultimately, feminist spaces are white, privileged, and racist, and so they will remain unless more people are willing to work on acknowledging that there is more to feminist struggles than gender identity.
3. Being forced to demystify the hijab
Everyone I have met has a unique and individualized reason as to why they wear the scarf.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/07/badass-muslim-feminists/,5 Badass Muslim Women Who Have Led Feminist Movements Around The World,"I once was at the United Nations for a conference when one of the white attendees got up and declared that she was organizing a conference on abuse against Muslim and Arab women (they’re not the same thing, but who cares?).
She went on and on about how there is no platform for them to talk about the violence they experience — she felt it is was important that she organize something around it.
After the event, I made my way to her. I introduced myself and told her I was interested in learning about the conference and the speakers she has lined up.
I asked her if she had reached out to any women-run organizations in the Middle East or the Muslim world. Her answer was simple: “No, I’m not aware of any. I don’t think they’re mobilized enough.”
I wish I was speechless but, when you grow up watching TV and seeing people who don’t look like you constantly speaking about your experiences, it becomes the norm.
I casually threw some names out to her but she didn’t bother to write them down. I didn’t bother to follow up with her.
This was never meant for us, and we didn’t need her conference to uplift our voices (or the voices of those who don’t look like us but still speak for us).
This conversation led me to delving deeper into the women who mobilize everyday to create change in their communities. The ones who sometimes go unrecognized by Western feminists because they do not fit the oppressed weak image of a Muslim woman.
So now, let me share with you women who were amazing at leading movements, mobilized, and led change in their spaces.
I share this with you to extend to you an invitation into the worlds in which we already operate in. they have existed for centuries, working tirelessly, to find justice in the most courageous of ways.
1. Hind Makki
What started as a personal frustration at the limited spaces for women to pray at mosques, Hind Makki started a Tumblr and Facebook page documenting the differences spaces provided for women in mosques across the world.
This conversation has been happening for years, where Muslim women were growing frustrated at how tiny, unclean, and inaccessible the rooms and spaces provided for women mosque-goers are.
Her idea was to show the disparity between sections and sometimes, the beauty of some spaces who get it right. This project receives hundreds of submissions from around the world of women sending in their mosque experiences.
Hind started the project in 2012 after her friend was nearly kicked out of her mosque after being berated for daring to pray in the male prayer area because the designated women’s section was a hot, moldy basement.
“It is my optimistic belief that as more people see photos of the spaces women must pray in, and hear our stories, we will gain more male allies who will collaborate with us to improve the situation,” Hind states on her Tumblr.
Read more about Hind’s movement and project here.
2. Hidayet Tuksal
Turkish feminist theologist, Hidayet Tuksal, offers a unique and empowered perspective in today’s polarized Turkey.
Prompted by the misogyny of her male colleagues in school, Tuksal began to study Islamic theology as a way to combat the religious sexist speech and to liberate the religious text from the readings of the male gaze.
Tuksal has faced harsh criticism from both the left wing feminists and the right. Wearing a headscarf in a time where ultra-secular Turkey had banned it in universities and public offices, Tuksal was a walking paradox.
In a country where you are either a headscarf-wearing, docile, ultra-orthodox Muslim woman or a staunch secular opposing the headscarf, Tuksal created a public space for an alternative.
A space for women who found themselves in Islam and were liberated in its text and practices.
“There is no single feminism, just as there is no single Islam,” Tuskal stated in an interview.
“Given this diversity, I can say I feel close to feminism based on the common denominator of rejecting and fighting mentalities that view the male as the essential human being and secondarize the female”.
3. Asma Lamrabet
A physician by profession, Moroccan feminist Asma worked as a doctor in Central America where she was exposed to Liberation Theology that helped her revisit understandings of liberation in her religion, Islam.
Liberation Theology is derived from the practice inspired in Christian movements in Latin America that prioritize the liberation and justice for the oppressed and derives religious understanding from this foundation.
Lamrabet focuses on discussing certain practices, such as the hijab, through a Western colonialist context. She also looks at the ways the Quran has been historically interpreted to uphold patriarchy due to cultural and political realities of certain times.
Lamrabet places emphasis on the violent history of Western colonialism and imperialism as a factor in the current gender and socio-political inequity found in many parts of the Muslim world.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/08/feminism-good-for-mental-health/,5 Awesome Ways Feminism Is Good for Your Mental Health,"Lately I’ve really been feeling it – the exhaustion, anger, sadness, and even hopelessness that can come with staying informed of all of the injustice that happens in our world.
Sometimes it feels like that’s what it means to be a feminist in this world – to see things as they truly are, to feel and carry the weight of the violence and trauma that surrounds us.
In some ways, it is. Seeing the systems of privilege and marginalization for what they are, over and over again, leads to very justifiable feelings of anger, sadness, and guilt. The emotional labor of staying informed and speaking out can wear on us – and when the violence just doesn’t stop and the perpetrators aren’t held accountable and the systems feel too big and powerful, it can be easy to give into the feelings of hopelessness that things will never change.
That’s when compassion fatigue, or burnout, can start to set in. That’s when our mental and emotional wellbeing can start to suffer.
The work of being a feminist – speaking out, showing up, and staying informed – can be emotionally draining, and it can be challenging some days to find hope, to make space for joy and celebration, and to prioritize our own and our community’s mental health and emotional wellbeing.
We can acknowledge these challenges inherent in activism, while also noting that the opposite is far worse. Sure, in some ways, ignorance can be bliss – though this is really only true for people in positions of privilege. But for those who are marginalized, awareness and action can be a matter of survival, and can mean the difference between shame and liberation, hope and hopelessness.
Taking on a feminist perspective certainly benefits our movement, and any work that we do to change the system is beneficial for us all. But how does this identity affect our sense of ourselves and our wellbeing?
Six in ten women in America identify as feminists, according to a recent national survey. So I ask this question: How might feminist thinking, identity, and action be beneficial (and even revolutionary!) when it comes to our individual and community wellbeing?
Here are five ways.
1. Increased Confidence and Empowerment
I’ll never forget when I first became a feminist.
I was fifteen, such a difficult age for some girls, as our bodies start to change, and our awareness of our bodies as sexual objects, of our expected roles in society, and of the messages about who we should be start to crystallize.
I remember feeling so ugly; I wasn’t confident about who I was or could be. I assumed that I deserved to feel insecure, to be made fun of, and that I was the only one.
Then I came across a feminist book that told me my body was mine, and mine alone. It told me that society tells girls that we should exist for others, and that our bodies must conform to impossible standards, that I was being conditioned by cultural messages to hate my body. The book told me that these were systemic problems, not individual. And it told me that I was not alone.
From there, my confidence grew. I was angry in a way that felt empowering – I could make my own decisions about how I received and reacted to sexist messaging; in fact, I could reject them altogether, and join in with others who did, too.
My sense of myself and what I could be grew as I reimagined the fairytales I was told as a little girl, the idea of being saved by a man or being the most desirable of women, of looking any particular way that pleased others more than myself.
There’s something beautiful about the first moment a girl finds feminism – that first sense of not being alone, of being connected to the experiences of others, the knowledge that there are larger systems underlying these problems, and that I could play a role in changing them.
Developing a feminist identity at such a young age in a world that is so hostile to girls can have a radical effect on one’s sense of self.
Being able to critique cultural pressures, as we learn to recognize and resist oppressive cultural messages about our bodies, our value, our roles in relationships and the world can create a new sense of personal and collective power in all of us.
2. Protective Against Psychological Distress
Did you know that women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression as men? Women who are unemployed, less educated, and have less access to wealth are at even higher risk, as are women of Color and immigrant women.
While the development of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety are linked to biological factors, systemic and social factors play a huge role in their development, diagnosis, and recovery. And while systemic factors like sexism, racism, and unequal distribution of wealth play a major role in their development, the cultural conversation, in the US at least, tends to stigmatize mental health disorders by positioning them as individual problems to be treated in isolation, perpetuating self-blame and shame in those who suffer from them.
So what can feminism do for these seemingly individual mental health issues?
Research shows that feminist identification can protect against and be a mode of recovery from depression and low self-esteem.
This is, of course, related to #1 – the feeling that comes with a feminist awareness, of not being alone in our experiences and externalizing blame, or the letting go of internalized sexism that keeps us blaming ourselves for experiences and feelings related to living as marginalized and oppressed people. These things deeply affect our psychological well-being.
Research also shows that feminist identification and perspective can play a huge role in body image and protecting against body image dissatisfaction, and that women with higher levels of feminist identity had lower levels of disordered eating, despite experiences of sexism.
It’s also been confirmed through research that women who identify with feminist values tend to have better overall wellbeing, particularly when it comes to our sense of purpose, our autonomy, and personal growth.
Self-efficacy, or one’s belief in one’s ability to succeed and accomplish goals, is also significantly associated with feminist identity and attitudes. So feminist identity, attitudes, and behaviors are not only good for our community and affecting broader change, but are significantly beneficial to our own well-being, including our psychological wellness, our relationships to our bodies, and our belief in ourselves.
3. More Egalitarian Relationships – And Safer Sex",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/take-care-of-yourself-as-feminist/,14 Simple (But Super Helpful) Ways to Take Care of Yourself as a Feminist,"Yay, you made it! If you’re a feminist reading this article, I’m calling this a victory already.
Whatever led you here – whether it was taking a break from work, getting a nudge from a friend, or finally getting back to those bookmarked self-care resources you’ve been meaning to look over – reading tips on how to take care of yourself is a great start to self-care.
Next comes the part that’s a little harder – actually putting the self-care tips you find here in action.
You might not be used to prioritizing your own self-care. Does any of the following sound familiar?
Being socially conditioned to put other people’s needs before your own. Committing to social justice work that requires emotional labor and a lot of your energy. Having days when you check off everything on your to do list except taking care of your own needs.
I know all of these things have gotten in the way of my own self-care. And then dealing with everyday annoyances and setbacks like online trolls, street harassment, and society’s all-around anti-feminist status quo saps my energy even more.
Sometimes I wonder: Who even has time for self-care? I read suggestions for ways to take care of myself, but at some point, they just start to feeling like they’re adding even more to my never-ending list of things I have to do.
But these suggestions have all emphasized the importance of self-care – and I get why it matters. Even when I don’t feel like putting myself first, I go back to the fact that I won’t be able to show up for others if I don’t take care of myself.
And then eventually, it becomes about more than that. Once I get in the habit of intentional self-care, I reconnect with why I really deserve to take care of me – even if it’s for the sake of nothing else but taking care of me.
It’s okay if you’re not there yet. It’s okay if the idea of self-care makes you groan because it means you have one more thing to add to your plate.
Give yourself some time to go through these ideas and see what feels right to you. Some might be more helpful than others – and unsurprisingly, the most important part of self-care is finding what works for you.
Self-care doesn’t necessarily have to be a whole new task to keep up with – it can be an inseparable part of your identity as a feminist.
Why would you include looking out for yourself in your approach to changing the world? Because you’re one valuable reason that feminist work matters.
No matter who you are or what you’ve been through, you deserve a world that recognizes your value.
Here are some ways you can affirm your own value by taking care of yourself.
1. Define Success on Your Own Terms
Your values probably align pretty closely with the goals of several feminist organizations and publications. But what does being an effective feminist mean to you?
No single organization is tailor-made to support your individual identity and needs. So think about the specific kind of role in the world that’s meaningful to you.
You can make this fun, like creating an art project with it or a fun Pinterest board that’s all about the world you want to build. Then, on those days when you don’t feel like you’re doing enough, you can revisit your vision of success for some encouragement.
Use your personal definition of success to remind yourself that, regardless of what anyone else in the movement is doing, you’re doing what’s best for you.
You can make progress with an act as simple as taking your meds for the day – or as big as registering for an exciting event.
Big or small, keep in mind that every action you take to nourish yourself is a step toward success worth celebrating.
2. Give Yourself Permission to Be a ‘Bad’ Feminist
As much as we’re all striving to be “good” feminists, the truth is that we’ve all got “bad” feminist skeletons in our closets.
My suggestion? Either throw out the whole idea that it’s possible to be a “bad” feminist, or reclaim your badness like a badge of pride.
There are people who would consider you a bad feminist for things like making mistakes in your activism, or not reading the movement’s most popular books, or not having the “right” education.
You’re allowed to learn at your own pace. Nobody is a perfect feminist, so do whatever you can to relieve the pressure to be one.
3. Embrace Your Mistakes as Learning Experiences
It’s one thing to dismiss people’s criticisms when you know they’re based on unrealistic ideals about being a perfect feminist – but it’s a different story when you’ve actually done something “wrong.”
Allowing yourself to make mistakes as an activist is easier said than done. It’s no fun to realize that in the process of doing what you can to stop oppression, you’ve done something oppressive yourself.
But there’s simply no way around it – you’re going to mess up. We all do. And it’s going to be uncomfortable, so the only thing to do now is learn to sit with that discomfort so it doesn’t shut you down.
Here’s something you can do when you realize you’ve made a mistake: Take a moment to breathe. Then ask yourself, “What can I learn from this?”
Thinking of your mistake as a learning experience can help you keep in motion. You can’t go back and erase what you’ve done, but you can apologize, embrace what this moment has taught you, and trust that you’ll be better for it from now on.
4. Schedule Time for Breaks
All this talk of moving forward, and you’d think self-care requires you to be in action all the time.
But actually, you can sometimes find the best growth and nourishment by taking a pause.
It’s easy to deprioritize taking breaks when you constantly feel like you have important things to do. But since constantly exerting your energy will inevitably lead to burnout, breaks are just as important as anything else.
So if you find yourself neglecting this vital piece of self-care, try scheduling it into your days.
I know Netflix will technically be there for you at any time – like when you finally stop working at midnight – but imagine for a moment that your favorite show only comes on at 1 pm.
Sounds like you need to schedule a lunch break. Set aside some time for an episode or a midday walk and you can come back recharged.
5. Keep Some of Your Problematic Faves
Speaking of Netflix, you don’t have to hide your watch history from me. I’ve got plenty of shows in mine that would fail miserably at a feminist media test.
When you learn to recognize oppression, you realize just how problematic the media you love can be.
It is important to think critically about the media we consume – but unfortunately, if you hold yourself to the standard of having no problematic faves, then you’ll end up with no faves at all.
You deserve to have fun. One of the ways I like to have fun is dancing to hip-hop music – and I wouldn’t get to do that as often if I swore off dancing to misogynistic lyrics.
So I’ve accepted that I have guilty pleasures, but that doesn’t mean I have to turn in my feminist card.
You can be aware of what’s problematic about the media – and advocate for better – while also giving yourself permission to be human and indulge in what you like about it just like the rest of us.
6. Put the ‘Joy’ Back in ‘Killjoy’
If you’re going to keep indulging in problematic media, there will be times when you’re the one pointing out what’s wrong with it.
And don’t the people around you just love it when you ruin everyone’s fun by bringing up the oppression in everything?
Maybe not. You might get shut down by people saying things like, “It’s just a movie – don’t be oversensitive.”
You don’t have to give up critically thinking about the media just because other people aren’t willing to go there. But if your feminist point of view saps your own joy out of the things you do for fun, you deserve some comic relief.
There’s nothing funny about media that perpetuates oppressive and violent ideas. But to help you recover from the disappointment of oppression in the media, you can find fun ways to clap back.
Hashtags like #GetElsaAGirlfriend and #OscarsSoWhite are examples of having fun while pushing for more representation of queer characters and people of color in the media.
Ship your favorite characters as queer, create memes that call out the ridiculous sexism in movie posters, write a parody backstory of the characters of color relegated to the background. Have some much-deserved fun as you envision the media you want in your life.
7. Pay Attention to Your Physical Needs
Compared to things like “guilty pleasures,” I know tips like eating, drinking water, and getting enough sleep seem pretty boring.
But I wouldn’t be looking out for your self-care if I didn’t mention your basic physical needs.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/05/white-feminists-feminine-energy/,4 Problems with the Way White Feminists Talk About ‘Feminine Energy’,"“Hey!” I greeted a date with a smile as I got into his car. While he was on the way, I’d expressed frustration with him being as late for our fifth date as he’d been for our third and fourth. But, after an apology, I was ready to let it go and have a good time.
“Huh, interesting,” he said with a pensive expression.
“What?”
“Well, I once read somewhere that masculine energy is like a river leading into the ocean. It knows where it’s going and it flows there in the most efficient manner possible. Feminine energy, on the other hand, is the ocean, with wild, beautiful, tumultuous waves.”
In other words, by changing my mood so quickly, I was being “feminine.”
“I just felt like we were done arguing and wanted to have a good night.”
“Okay, maybe I’m overanalyzing it.”
He was, but he didn’t make this up. I’d heard this idea of “feminine energy” before, sometimes from feminists. I’d even found some liberation from internalized misogyny through it.
Growing up, I was taught to perform behaviors that our Western, capitalist culture perceives as “masculine” (and therefore valuable), such as to achieve and value work above all else, repress my emotions, and assess my self-worth based on money.
Others may have different definitions of masculinity, but the people in my life associated these traits with men and superiority.
Hearing about “feminine energy” from some feminist friends and New Age books gave me a way to identify why it felt like my fixation on logistics and rules and structure existed at the detriment of my passion and creativity.
I learned that the former traits were “masculine” ones imposed on us by Western society, the latter were “feminine,” and the way we associate these traits with gender shapes how we view them.
Since I’ve learned how masculine qualities and behaviors get prized over “feminine” ones and why that’s harmful, I’ve gotten more in touch with my wild, intuitive, nonsensical, disorderly side that wants to do things like spend a day with no plans and cry just because it feels good.
But after seeing how these ideas can lead people like my ex to pigeonhole people, I started to question them. After all, I’m a woman who struggles with being too “masculine,” so hearing that I’m innately “feminine” was super alienating to me.
And who was I, as a white person, to claim to understand concepts borrowed from Hinduism and Buddhism based on a few books largely written by other white outsiders’ version of feminine energy?
Feminine energy, I realized, sounded suspiciously like the Western stereotype of women and masculine energy sounded like the stereotype of men. And that makes it dangerous to propose that there’s some spiritual, culturally transcendent principle behind both.
I understand the appeal of affirming the set of qualities commonly labeled feminine. After all, these are the traits patriarchy has deemed inferior, leading people to misinterpret strengths as weaknesses just because they’re associated with women.
I also see the appeal of making these affirmations spiritual.
The symbolism associated with gendered bodies and roles can be powerful, and some of us really experience gender as an “energy” – something too intangible to be defined more concretely.
But as a woman, a non-binary person, and a feminist, the concept of feminine energy has ultimately harmed me. It’s caused people to misinterpret my behavior because they’ve projected their idea of gender onto me. It’s led people to make assumptions about me based on my physical appearance.
It’s also part of a larger pattern of white people appropriating concepts from Asian and Native American cultures. The concept of masculine and feminine energies – and the whole “New Age” movement they’re part of – often represents a warped version of ideas borrowed from Hinduism, Buddhism, or Native spirituality.
Here are some reasons why white people, particularly white feminists, need to stop talking about “feminine energy.”
1. It Associates Certain Personality Traits with Certain Bodies
Discussions of feminine energy often use metaphors involving wombs, breasts, or vaginas to illustrate that the feminine is capable of nurturing life.
Consequently, even when people who believe in “feminine energy” admit that not all women are feminine, they usually say that most are because the “female body” lends itself to nurturing, softness, gestation, and other things considered “feminine.”
The implication for me is that because I have a body that other people read as female but don’t identify as feminine, I’m just not in touch with my inner goddess.
The implication for trans and non-binary people in general is that since they don’t identify with the “energy” their bodies supposedly contain, they’re not being their true selves.
This is a perfect way to claim authority about everyone’s gender: If they think they’re not the gender that “matches” their bodies, they’re just repressed. That’s super invalidating to those who are actually being themselves by being gender-nonconforming.
In reality, your body can mean whatever you want it to mean. The power of certain bodies to give birth is beautiful, but your uterus doesn’t have to be a nurturer of life and your breasts don’t have to symbolize your potential as a caretaker or erotic object – they can just be there with no meaning at all.
Your vagina doesn’t have to indicate how receptive and passive you are. It can show you’re fierce, and active, and literally able to engulf someone – or, once again, mean nothing at all.
It’s okay to employ this symbolism as long as we understand it’s not objective. You can assign whatever symbolism you want to a body, and making a body read as female out to be “feminine” is just one possibility.
2. It Promotes the Idea That There’s an Objective Definition of Femininity and Masculinity
I once mentioned to a friend that aggression is part of our culture’s definition of masculinity, and he responded that the real definition of masculinity is assertiveness.
You hear this a lot: “True masculinity is showing vulnerability. Real men respect women. Femininity actually is powerful.”
While these are seemingly more positive definitions of masculinity and femininity, we shouldn’t be defining masculinity or femininity at all.
When we talk about masculine and feminine energies, we’re usually implying that while certain cultures and unique individuals may see these genders a certain way, there’s also an objective way to see them. As the above examples illustrate, we may even contrast cultures’ definitions of gender with their “true” definitions.",feminism

http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/02/feminists-who-date-trump-supporters/,A Letter to Young Feminists Who Date Trump Supporters,"(Content Warning: misogyny, Nazis, rape, intimate partner violence)
Originally published on Medium and republished here with the author’s permission.
Dear young person,
First, let me say that this applies regardless of your a/gender and the a/gender of the person you love. Know that people of all a/genders may experience this and perpetuate this, especially, but not exclusively, in youth.
However, there is a particular pattern of cis white girls who date cis white boys whose political views “don’t match.”
Except it’s not that their political views don’t match: It’s that his views exist in a framework wherein you are less of a person – with less agency, less competency, and less nuanced an inner life than he.
This dates back to the pre-Trump days, but has been exacerbated in the era of white nationalism, Pepe, and the Nazi-who-doesn’t-want-to-be-called-a-Nazi who got punched.
Young white men are finding themselves intoxicated by toxic masculinity and grasping at political ideologies that are not simply “controversial,” but are, in fact, potentially dangerous and damaging.
And it’s okay to note that and act accordingly.
Many of us are conditioned to believe that true tolerance is the ability to stomach and even politely nod along with opinions that are different from our own and that, in doing so, we are making the world a more harmonious place.
Young women, especially, are groomed to acquiesce in moments of disagreement.
Never is this more true that when the person you love, as a young person, has what appear to be fully formed and forceful opinions about politics, current events, and ideologies:
We disagreed on almost everything, but that’s what made him interesting. I started to see the actual human person behind the vote leave badge, something I’d never tried to do before.
After they got over the initial shock of our “opposites attract” relationship, the main reaction to him from my friends and family has been baffled amusement. Upon meeting him for the first time, one of my closest friends, who’s bisexual, got into an argument with him after he claimed her sexuality didn’t exist. Despite this, they’re now both good friends.
But young person, I want to say this clearly and without mincing words: You are not required to abide by “political opinions” that question or demean your humanity. In fact, you should not abide by them.
“Agree to disagree” reads the now-viral tweet that features the girl in the Nasty Woman shirt with the rainbow flag beside the boy in a Make America Great Again hat and the Meninist crewneck. Click through to see that his Twitter timeline is full of retweets of Tomi Lahren monologues and statements about “’Merica.”
The girl in the picture is not, as many have assumed, his girlfriend – but that doesn’t change the story that the picture tells much. She is his friend, and she is complicit.
And anyway, his girlfriend isn’t difficult to find. Her timeline is absent of politics, but peppered with single-line tweets like “i hate that i get soo upset about the little things” and “i’m so dumb” and “i hate how sensitive i can get.”
Of course, I don’t know these girls, but in a way, I kind of do – because I was this girl. And what I needed to hear was that this is not the default.
You don’t need to bend to fit this. This is not good for you. You don’t need this.
There was no Twitter when I was your age, young person, but there were plenty of other ways for lonely, isolated young men to find and cling to ideologies that demeaned others.
“Fuck feminism,” one partner said to me in his car. “Women are fine. Women are already equal. Feminism makes it harder for men to get into college. It makes it harder to get a job. It’s not fair.”
“Equal rights, equal fights,” he’d joke. One of his favorite other jokes was the one about the woman with two black eyes. He told it to me at least twice.
A budding feminist myself, his aggressive disagreement with my understanding of the world – and really, with me and my own experiences – made me a bit smaller and, more than that, stopped my own concrete ideologies from taking root.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/11/dad-stereotypes-anti-feminist/,These 8 Dad Stereotypes Are Anti-Feminist – And It’s Time to Ditch Them,"Originally published on Ravishly and republished here with their permission.
It’s the 21st century, and there are still dad stereotypes that are not only anti-feminist, but also downright backwards thinking.
And they need to stop.
But you can’t stop something until you know what it is. So here is a list.
1. Dads Care More About Having Fun Than Actually Parenting
A lot of the images in memes show fathers either riding their children’s bikes while the kids run after them, or the father playing his kids’ video games without giving the kids a chance.
Or worse, the father enjoying himself while his kids stand around waiting to be showered and put to bed
Not only is this a gross stereotype, but also an incredibly harmful one because it implies that a father’s authority is not on par with a mother’s.
2. Dads Are Perpetually Bad Cooks
Despite the fact that some of the greatest living chefs are men and that more and more men openly admit to loving to spend their days in the kitchen whipping up something for themselves or their loved ones, there continues to be this implication that the kitchen in inherently a “woman’s place.”
Not only does it devalue the effort a father — and any man, really — puts into feeding his family, it also strengthens the sexist idea that women are no good unless they can cook.
3. Dads Care More About Maintaining Appearances Than Their Child
We’ve all seen that episode of that family sitcom where a boy wants to do something traditionally “girly,” and the dad goes out of his way to try to convince the kid that he should do something “manly” instead.
It’s often played as a joke to make the father seem out of touch with modernity and something to laugh at, but laughing at someone who has been raised with harmful patriarchal ideas is never a solution. Education is.
I always see the father succumbing to his son’s wishes instead — never have I seen the episode end with the father realizing that there’s nothing wrong with his son dressing up as a fairy.
4. Dads Don’t Like to Spend Quality Time with Their Kids
Be it because they’re always working and are too tired to give their kids the time of day, or because it’s supposed to be a mother’s job to bond with the children — it’s so untrue.
Most dads would love to be able to spend all their time with their kids, whom they undoubtedly love to death and want to bond with.
Alternately, there are mothers who need a break from their children just to be with their own friends or even just by themselves.",feminism
https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/09/no-body-positivity-no-feminism/,3 Reasons Why You Can’t Have Body Positivity Without Feminism,"This article was originally published in Beauty School and republished here with the author’s permission
I was a guest on a body-positive podcast when the lightbulb went off: Not everyone in this work identifies as feminist.
There I was, sitting on my couch, my iPhone earbuds in, staring at the empty Skype screen in front of me, while the host asked me the most basic questions about what liberation from patriarchy looks like in practice. I can’t raise one eyebrow — hell, I can’t even wink — but if I had possessed the skill, an eyebrow would have been raised in suspicion.
Maybe I had been naive before. Or maybe because my forays into both social justice and body acceptance had happened simultaneously, there was obvious overlap for me. But it hadn’t occurred to me that it was possible to talk about body oppression without an explicitly intersectional feminist lens.
The truth is: You can’t.
You can’t have body positivity without feminism.
But the longer I’m involved with this work, the more I notice how frequently people (and, unsurprisingly, usually the most privileged folks) support the former without the latter — and how fucking harmful that is.
And yet, I (and others, especially more marginalized people) receive a lot of pushback from quote-unquote #BOPO babes when I engage with them on this. Whether they explicitly believe that feminism and body acceptance are unrelated or more implicitly just don’t infuse their body positivity with justice-oriented values, these folks feel offended, attacked, bullied, or called out when they’re approached about this misalignment.
So I want to be clear: If you’re doing body-positive work, you’re borrowing directly from feminism. And if you’re not owning that and practicing its inherent values, your body positivity is useless.
Here are three reasons why.
1. Viewing Bodies Socioculturally Is Rooted in Feminist Theory
I’m honestly confused about folks who can talk all day about tools of patriarchy – like narrow beauty standards and advertising media – without ever actually using the word patriarchy.
There’s a clear understanding within the #BOPO realm that women are culturally conditioned to hate our bodies and that our approximation to beauty is what defines our social value. The conversation about how we’re not born with self-hatred, but taught it through propaganda, is there.
But where do you think those ideas came from?
The concept that our bodies are imbued with socially constructed meaning – and that we need to unpack that to get at the core of the problem – isn’t new. It’s been the foundation of various feminist theory for, like, ever.
The idea of body acceptance is rooted in a structural evaluation of the world. And every watered down thing you say about women and bodies comes from a much more complex history of feminist analysis.
Need a place to start? Try Susan Bordo’s Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body.
2. Body-Based Oppression Exists On Intersecting Axes
Listen: Body-based oppression is a social justice issue. More to the point: It’s anintersectional issue. It’s not something that only affects women (or “men, too!”); it’s not even something that only affects people on the axis of a/gender. Body-based oppression is an inherent part of all marginalization.
Racial profiling is body-based oppression. Discrimination for disability is body-based oppression. Lack of access to healthcare, nutritious food, and shelter is body-based oppression. The fetishization of queer women is body-based oppression. The murder of trans women is body-based oppression. Fat stigma is body-based oppression.
Intersectionality — a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, and a concept discussed previously by many Black feminists, including Audre Lorde and Patricia Hill Collins — is the idea that we are all constellations, not single stars. I am not only a woman or only queer or only white or only cisgender. I am all of those things at once. And all of those identities together affect my experience within my body and society’s experience of it.
We can’t leave this shit out.
Body positivity has to be feminist because it has to be intersectional.
And if you’re ready to learn more about that (please! please be ready!), start perusing The Body Is Not an Apology.
3. Fat Acceptance Is Being Diluted
Let’s be clear: Body positivity was stolen from fat acceptance. No, this isn’t up for debate.
The fat acceptance movement – which arguably unofficially began in 1967 when 500 New Yorkers took to Central Park to protest anti-fat bias but had stirrings leading up to that point – is a sociopolitical movement to end suffering under and seek liberation from the institution of power known as the thin ideal.
This means pushing for fairer representation of fat people in media. It means demanding that the fashion industry take fat bodies into consideration. It means pressuring the medical industrial complex to stop exploiting the “obesity crisis.” It means asking for research studies with less inherent bias.
It means commanding the recognition of fat people’s full humanity by the public at large.
It’s radical AF.
Body positivity, on the other hand – and particularly the way it shows up in mainstream culture – is a movement for folks to make peace with their bodies, without a specific target audience. It’s much broader – and way less revolutionary.
It’s also a thief. It takes the radical, complex aims of deconstructing the thin ideal for fat acceptance and dilutes it into a more general goal of women’s empowerment. And then it profits off of the work that more marginalized people did.
Keep your eye out for the upcoming documentary Fattitude to learn more.
Feminism was at the heart of this thing. And we need to put it back.
Body acceptance is a beautiful – and wildly important – thing. I need it. You need it. Your mom’s brother’s neighbor’s kid’s best friend’s teacher needs it. But it’s only ever going to do us any good if we keep it feminist, intersectional, and radical.
Because the apolitical, watered down, scared-of-the-F-word body positivity that’s so popular right now might make (some of) us feel affirmed, but it’s not a revolt.
And we need a revolt.

http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/07/from-asshole-to-an-activist/,How Intersectional Feminism Transformed Me from an Asshole to an Activist,"After leading my students, all high school seniors, on a field trip to a local domestic violence (DV) organization to get a better understanding of intimate partner violence (IPV), I didn’t expect to be the one to leave with an epiphany.
On the bus ride back to school, I messaged my ex who had been with me through many of those thrashing years of high school and college:“Whenever I hear about methods of control in DV situations, I hear echoes of a younger, way-more-insecure me. I am so sorry you had to deal with that me. Sorry also that it has taken this many years to apologize.”
She was “floored.” I responded that I hoped that the floor was clean. My past certainly has not been. What’s more, I spent much of my life never fully understanding how dirty I was.
Long before I joined Everyday Feminism, I joined Facebook and began reconnecting with childhood folks who knew that younger me. One woman, who I had never been particularly nice to in my adolescence, praised an article I wrote on male privilege and asked how I “started to get it.”
Though she didn’t say it like this, the question I heard, knowing my history, was: How did you go from being such an asshole to a writer for Everyday Feminism?
A fair question, one I more than earned.
But it’s a complicated question. First, I’m still a bit of an asshole, though I make a conscious effort to keep any assholery separate from systems of oppression. Second, I have editors telling me this piece is supposed to be an article, not a memoir.
But the article-length answer is that, over the course of my life, I have found numerous frameworks to help me makes sense of my behaviors – and unlearn them, or at least try to.
Let’s start with what I learned from working with DV organizations:
1. The Power and Control Wheel
Because most cis, straight men like myself don’t formally study issues of gender, when we think of intimate partner violence, we usually think of illegal acts – physical and sexual violence. Many DV organizations refute these misconceptions using the Power and Control Wheel.
Notice that only the outside of the wheel consists of those illegal acts. The spokes, however, are full of perfectly legal – and abusive – behaviors.
During that field trip, when I looked at a few of those spokes, it was like looking into a mirror – or through a window at a younger me.
While I had always been a good kid in most ways, my goodness didn’t mean I was exempt from many of those spokes.
For example, during the years with my ex, when I was feeling particularly hurt or vulnerable, it was not uncommon to unleash a fury of punching directed at the nearest wall, windshield, or sometimes myself – leaving me with dents in bedroom walls, cracked skin and windshields, headaches – and a very scared partner.
When I discuss the Power and Control Wheel with my students, they confirm that such behaviors are alarmingly common.
A therapist I once worked with – one whom I sought out because of my inability to access my emotions – taught me that those fits were a consequence of masculinity. My emotions would spill out as rage because I, as a cis man, was trained to suppress them until they consumed me.
According to her, I was a victim of masculinity. Liking that narrative, I wrote that interpretation in ink for many years.
I now interpret those fits of rage as a means of control, a textbook case of “Using Intimidation” on the Wheel. If my partner answered a loaded question with the answer that hurt me, she risked a punching storm. It was far safer to tell me what I wanted to hear.
Other behaviors of mine that permeate the Wheel might better be described today as gaslighting, which Shea Emma Fett describes as “an attempt to overwrite another person’s reality.”
I remember on numerous occasions actually blaming my ex when men hit on her – as if I had somehow become the victim. Instead of viewing these unwelcome advances by others as harassment against her, I viewed them as threats against me that could lure away my primary source of validation – my girlfriend.
Even without the Wheel, it’s obvious how problematic these behaviors are, and I cringe rehashing them in writing. But the Wheel gave me a framework to reflect on behaviors I had not thought about in years. It spurred a wave of nostalgia – except that they were shitty memories, not sentimental ones, that rushed back into my consciousness.
Of course, I didn’t develop these behaviors in a vacuum.
I had help – like an entire society training me not just how to gain control over my partner but also that I was entitled to do so.
It is a kind of cooking
the male child undergoes:
to toughen him, he is dipped repeatedly
in insult—peckerwood, shitbag, faggot,
pussy, dicksucker—until spear points
will break against his epidermis,
until his is impossible to disappoint.
I bring up this training not to pass the buck or let me off the hook. After all, I embraced much of it. I chose to enroll in weight training classes for more aesthetic than health reasons. I chose to watch those shows full of gratuitous objectification. I chose to cannonball into the waters of superficiality.
But it’s important to more deeply understand the source of one’s actions.
Harris O’Malley defines toxic masculinity as a “narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status, and aggression.”
I was playing out a script of toxic masculinity that I didn’t necessarily author, and realizing this fact helped me find a new script – even if I couldn’t forget many of the lines from the old one.
Toxic masculinity is the mainstream school that too many of us attend to learn abusive behaviors. And while anyone can exhibit abusive behaviors, if we look at IPV, cis straight men are far more likely to be the perpetrators.
According to PolitiFact, there have been 71 deaths due to extremist attacks on US soil from 2005 to 2015. Compare that to the drumbeat of women killed by their intimate partners, which number three daily. In California alone, there were 118 domestic violence-related homicides in 2015. On average, there are nearly 11 murder-suicides nationally each week. Most involve a man killing his wife or girlfriend using a gun. But they get little sustained media attention.
Recent years have been banner years for toxic masculinity, as The Representation Project recently highlighted in a three-minute video.
But the ‘70s and ‘80s contained enough toxic masculinity to require that the rest of my life be spent unlearning and deprogramming.
Understanding the concepts of the true and false self accelerated the deprogramming.
In my message to my ex, I mentioned that my youth had been marked by extreme insecurity. I was a skinny White kid whose only remarkable quality was how thoroughly unremarkable I was. I lived directly atop of the bell curve.
Having my love returned by a remarkable person was validating. But also problematic, as I found self-worth not from myself, which is where you’d expect to find self worth, but from my relationship.
Mary Pipher – author of Reviving Ophelia, the classic (White) feminist text from the ‘90s – frames this type of validation as symptomatic of the “false self,” which is socially scripted, most often by unhealthy sources like the market-driven media.
Pipher writes, “With the false self in charge, all validation came from outside the person. If the false self failed to gain approval, the person was devastated.”
She wrote this with adolescent girls in mind, but other a/genders can also find the framing useful. After all, we can all relate – at some level – to the pain involved when we can’t own all of our “emotions and thoughts that are not socially acceptable.”
In contrast, people honoring their “true selves” accept themselves, rather than waiting for others to accept them. Not having fully accepted myself, I drew an unhealthy amount of value from my relationship.
And if my ex had power over my self worth, I consciously and unconsciously did what I could to get control over her. And toxic masculinity normalized my behaviors so I could act without self-examination.
Exploring my true self, however, led to some really heavy questions – like who the fuck am I, really?
What truly feeds and nurtures me? The answers to those questions, for me and most folks,don’t include hurting the ones we care about. In fact, I wonder how many abusive people are abusive because they have denied themselves their true selves.
In the end, we all lose when we play out someone else’s script.
In my experience, the good/bad binary is a counterproductive mindset more commonly applied to racism. If we believe that only bad people can be racist, then we’re far less likely to explore and own our racism.
But such a binary ignores the complexity of our world. In a racist world, as a White American, I can internalize racist thoughts even as I try to be a good person.
The same is true with gender discrimination, as Maisha Z. Johnson argues thoroughly here. The good/bad binary is a set-up to ensure problematic behaviors go unchecked.
Yes, I was a good kid – a good student, a good employee, and a good athlete. But that all of that goodness didn’t mean I was a good boyfriend. My resume of goodness didn’t negate all of the damage I’ve caused.
It didn’t negate the time I shouted at my girlfriend so loudly during an argument that a neighbor called the cops. It didn’t negate all the times I policed the clothing choices of my partners. And it doesn’t negate that I continue to struggle to find better outlets for my anger than yelling.
And just like I need to face my privilege and racist thoughts, I need to face these behaviors. I need to own that damage, not avoid it.
Understanding the set-up of the good/bad binary has helped me do so.
So how did go from that embarrassing mess of a young person to a less messy 44-year-old who spends so many of his waking hours challenging systems of oppression?
Maybe it was anti-racist work that led me to feminism, but feminism deepened my understanding of these powerful systems that cause so much pain, systems of which I no longer wanted to be part.
And feminism led me closer to my true self and it brought me to that DV organization, which was created by feminism. And while I wish I had learned these insights sooner, I’m forever grateful to feminism.
I am forever thankful to have stumbled upon this brilliant ideology that names my realities and shows me how the culture is to blame, for giving me a framework to understand why what’s happened to me has happened to me, and why the world is so painful to so many.
But don’t get me wrong: I’m not done learning. And this piece is by no means an exhaustive list of the shit – present and past – that I need to own.
And I didn’t write this so I can pat myself on the back.
I wrote this so that more cis men can better understand their toxic behaviors.
And then they can free themselves of them so that they are not messaging apologies twenty years too late.

http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/12/anti-feminist-women/,4 Reasons Anti-Feminist Women Hate Feminism (And What They’re Missing),"“I don’t need female empowerment, because I’m not weak!”
“I’m not a feminist because I don’t hate men.”
“I don’t need feminism. I actually like cooking for my husband.”
I used to agree with a lot of statements like this. I thought feminists were only doing harm to themselves and others, and I proudly proclaimed that I was not a feminist.
What changed my mind was learning that a lot of what I thought feminists believed was false – including the idea that gender oppression only affects women. Some of it was just myth, things that anti-feminists said feminists believed. Some of it was taking the words of one or two feminists and assuming they spoke for the whole.
Nobody can speak for all of feminism, including me – and I especially can’t speak for how a/gender minorities besides cis women experience feminism. But I did learn over time, through getting to know more people who identified as feminists, that the things I thought were basic and fundamental to feminism were exaggerations, or belonged only to some more fringe groups.
One of the biggest misconceptions about feminism is that it’s a movement for women, by women, and made up of women in opposition of men. In truth, not only should feminism should benefit everyone, as it works to dismantle all systems of oppression, but it shouldn’t be based on this binary gender thinking in the first place. Not only men and women exist, and they’re not opposites in a binary.
But a lot of the ways in which anti-feminists conceptualize feminism is based on this untruth about women versus men. And in order to address those specific misconceptions, I’m going to speak from that place. Non-binary people may recognize themselves in these experiences as well, but those experiences (especially insofar as erasure is concerned) are unique, and I’m not qualified to speak on them.
I’m not here to say that all women should call themselves feminist. There are good reasons not to, including the ways feminism has failed to be intersectional and meet the needs of people of color, trans and gender non-confirming people, and others.
But if you are anti-feminist and agree with some of the quotes that I started this article with, I’d ask you to read on and consider that the truth about feminism might be more complicated.
1. ‘Feminists Are Just Playing the Victim’
“Sure, sexism used to be a problem. But now women have reached equality: We can vote, we have the same access to jobs and education as men, we’re allowed to dress how we want, and are considered equal partners in relationships. Western feminists are just whining, nit-picking, and enjoying feeling victimized instead of appreciating the freedoms we have.”
There’s a lot of truth in this argument: Women have come a long way, baby.
As a woman, I’d rather live here and now than almost any other point in history. And I’m not denying the struggles that many girls and women around the world face, or claiming that mine are equal to theirs.
But it’s not true to say that sexism is dead. We may have slain the giant dragon of institutional sexism, which insisted that women fill an inferior role in the world, but there is still a hornet’s nest of sexist culture that lives on.
And while I’d rather be stung by a dozen hornets than be eaten by a dragon, that doesn’t mean that I don’t have a right to complain about the stings.
When I’m in a professional meeting with men, I often have to fight to get my voice heard – and if I talk as much or as confidently as the men do, I may get labeled “bossy” or “shrill.” When I leave the house, strangers feel free to comment on my body, which makes me feel unsafe and exposed. Men I meet tend to evaluate me first as a sexual object, and only second (or never) as a competent or interesting human.
These things make a difference.
They don’t make it impossible for me to have a good job, to go about my day, and to have the kinds of relationships I want, but they do make it harder. Any one thing by itself would be no big deal, but in time they add up.
Just like you can brush off one hornet sting, but if you got stung every day, multiple times a day, all over your body, you might start to get really, really bothered by it.
Now, when I talk about the ways sexism hurts me, I’m not whining or making things up. I don’t think of myself as a victim, and I don’t actually enjoy complaining. I’m also not saying I’m not glad I have the freedom to vote, to apply for any job I want, and to be viewed as a full legal human.
I’m just saying that I’m still hurt by sexism, and that I want the world to be better for myself and other women.
2. ‘Feminism Says Women Are Weak’
“Women may have a few obstacles that men don’t, but feminism actually insults women by acting like they’re not able to overcome those obstacles. It encourages women to be sensitive and thin-skinned instead of being tough and going after their goals. Women don’t need feminism. We’re strong enough to succeed on our own.”
It’s true that some women are capable of overcoming every obstacle that sexism puts in their way. We have women heading up corporations, pioneering scientific discoveries, and this past election, a woman came incredibly close to being elected the next president of the United States.
Powerful, successful women like Oprah Winfrey, Sally Ride, and Melinda Gates prove that women can do anything men can, even with the added burden of institutional sexism.
But the strength of these women, while I admire and celebrate it, shows off a part of the problem.
Women can achieve just about every success men can, but they have to be stronger, tougher, and usually more qualified than their male counterparts. They need to be thick-skinned enough to shrug off harassment. They need to walk a fine line of being assertive without being judged “bossy” or “bitchy.”
Among CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, for the last several years, between 20 and 25 have been women – around 4-4.5%. Those 20+ women are impressive, and their achievement shouldn’t be underrated, but that percentage is discouraging.
Less than 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women: If that doesn’t show that sexism is still making it harder for women to reach the top of their field, what does it show? I simply don’t believe that men are, on average, 19 times better at corporate leadership skills than women.
Similarly, many women in scientific fields have talked about the barriers that keep them from advancing, and often that keep them from staying in the field at all.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/07/need-feminism-in-schools/,The Top 8 Reasons Why We Need Feminism in Our Schools,"In 2002, a group of high school girls approached their male teacher and argued that his course needed to include a study of gender. After all, it was titled “Citizenship and Social Justice” and included an intensive study of race and racism.
Predictably, this White male teacher responded defensively. “We can’t study everything,” he retorted. “If we include gender, doesn’t that mean we have include every social justice issue? That’s impossible. Where do we draw the line?”
These young women persisted, even offering to help plan the curriculum. Fortunately, they didn’t need to stage a sit-in or lead a hunger strike or chain themselves to chairs to convince their teacher.
If you haven’t already guessed, that defensive male teacher was yours truly. Despite my status-quo-subverting teaching, I had become the man, the barrier that students had to surmount before receiving the education they deserved.
And it makes sense that I had been more equipped to teach about race than gender. Throughout my career, I have found numerous trainings on racism to aid a teacher. Gender justice trainings, on the other hand, are few and far between.
And I don’t mean to minimize the need for racial justice in our schools. In fact, my primary mission in this world is to expand the study of race and increase Ethnic Studies offerings in our public schools.
But we also need Gender Studies.
Here are eight reasons why (in no particular order):
In the last ten years, rates of depression among girls and women have increased twofold.
Suicide was the number one leading cause of death in teenage girls (ages 15-18) globally in 2014.
Among children as young as 6-8, half of girls feel they should be thinner.
If girls are to navigate such an oppressive landscape, they need to better understand it. Understanding it requires analysis.
No one questions the analysis of literature in the classroom. But Shakespeare and others of the literary canon do not lurk on billboards, grocery store shelves, and cell phone screens, sending sex-obsessed, slut-shaming, fat-shaming, whitewashed, youthwashed, heterosexist, cissexist, ableist messages, all with one take-away in common: you are not good enough.
Literature does not teach this lesson; our culture does. So let’s study that text as well.
2. Our culture is toxic to boys
While I would never argue that the box of masculinity causes the same suffering as a culture of misogyny, a box is still constricting and limiting.
And the statistics also reveal a disturbing portrait of boyhood. The Representation Project reports:
Suicide is the third leading cause of death for boys.
Compared to girls, boys are two times more likely to flunk or drop out of school, two times more likely to receive special education services, and four times more likely to be expelled.
Perhaps poetry can make the point better than numbers. In “The Replacement,” Tony Hoagland powerfully shows us the growing-up process for many boys:
It is a kind of cooking
the male child undergoes:
to toughen him, he is dipped repeatedly
in insult–peckerwood, shitbag, faggot,
pussy, dicksucker– until spear points
will break against his epidermis,
until his is impossible to disappoint.
Boys too benefit from deconstructing these systems. Without deconstructing them, you can’t reconstruct a culture that allows boys to show emotions without social repercussions. Or a world that allows boys to solve a problem without violence.
3. Our culture is toxic to those who challenge the gender binary
Think back to your primary and secondary classroom experiences. Can you think of even one non-binary perspective in any of your classes? Or an agender perspective? Or even a transgender perspective?
A Gender Studies course, at least a good one, provides a home for these perspectives that otherwise face near complete erasure in our schools, not to mention in mainstream media.
And while some schools have support groups, like Gay-Straight Alliances, representation and support should not come just from a club that meets outside of class time, but from the school itself. And part of a school is its curricula.
The reality is that trans youth and queer youth of color are among our most vulnerable school populations. Gender Studies courses not only increase their positive representation in the curriculum but they also educate the masses who have the privilege to be unaware of LGBTQIA+ issues and are the ones most likely to create a hostile educational environment.
4. Too many students face harassment and violence on a regular basis
Many of my students, primarily young women, report that street harassment occurs regularly on their daily commutes to and from school.
Studies consistently show that queer women experience some of the highest rates; according to the Stop Street Harassment, “seven of 10 LGBT people experienced street harassment by age 17, compared to 49 percent of straight people.”",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/03/myths-stay-at-home-moms/,5 Sexist Assumptions About Stay-at-Home Moms All Feminists Need to Shut Down,"Inclusivity is the crux of feminism.
But, if feminism truly is for everyone as much as we say, why do we so frequently talk about it at the expense of a very large group of women?
I’m talking about stay-at-home-moms and wives — specifically cisgender women in heterosexual relationships with cisgender men — who seem to be regularly excluded from the movement because of their willingness to place raising families and children over the pursuit of a career.
The mainstream understanding of feminism seems to view women who choose to stay at home as catering to the patriarchy’s prescribed gender norms.
We’re taught that to be radical is to not want children or a significant other — and sometimes to go as far as writing that desire off as utterly reprehensible.
On the other hand, women who choose to focus on their careers, instead of prioritizing family, are widely-praised bastions of feminism who use their fierce independence and intelligence to contribute to academia, the GDP, literature, and any other traditionally male-dominated field you can think of.
When I first began to delve into feminism, I thought there was definitely a clear distinction between women who prioritized their careers and women who prioritized building families, particularly with their spouse. I regularly wondered that if feminism championed independence, what could be more antithetical than relying on a spouse’s income?
Although I eventually learned that feminism is much more multi-faceted than financial independence and ultimately advocates for the freedom of independence, I assumed that feminism was this tug of war between these two juxtaposing “sects” of women — a divide created by patriarchy and cemented by mainstream feminist movements.
I was in my final year of college perusing the job market when, at the same time, engagement rings seemed to sparkle upon the finger of every girl in my classes. Even though I went to one of the largest public universities in the country, its rural location ensured many of our student body came from smaller towns with backgrounds steeped in more traditionally religious and gendered values.
This meant that there were a higher percentage of women getting engaged, married, and settling down in the masses — every one of my Facebook procrastination breaks involved scrolling through a flurry of bridal gowns on my news feed.
It felt unnatural to want to settle down so early, so I wrote off these women as the very antithesis of feminism while saluting the self-proclaimed single cat ladies who were out there pursuing their wild career dreams. The married women’s adherence to standard gender roles made me feel more empowered about my decision to actively work towards gender equality by pursuing a career external to my home and family.
Here’s why so many of us instinctively gravitate to such a mindset: the debate between whether stay-at-home mothers can be feminists is a distorted product of feminism’s advocation of financial independence.
Nobody likes to admit it, but money runs our lives and achieving our own economic agency is not only empowering, but allows us to independently lead the lives we have the right to.
When it comes to making a name for ourselves, being present in every industry and living off our own money is so integral to equality.
Since many stay-at-home mothers do not have their own income, their choices can seem like an intentional decision to diminish their full potential. In the cishetero sphere, the sole reliance on a man’s income works to further the rift.
I want to say that engaging in heteronormative gender roles, choosing to make parenting and/or nurturing a partner your life’s work, and not being financially independent are not problems in and of themselves. At all.
However, when women who are stay at home wives and mothers are in situations where they cannot maximize their potential as humans because of compulsive or forced social andor political reasons, their obligation of standard gender roles does become a problem.
When women consciously choose to raise a family and take care of household matters, that shouldn’t be anyone’s business but theirs.
And it’s not un-feminist!
Taking away feminism from women who opt to nurture their family is like saying people who choose to be vegan, despite an array of meat and dairy products they could have, are not receiving the full culinary experience of life you believe they should.
It was prejudiced of me to jump to such conclusions, but for most of us it takes some time to weed out the societal conditioning when adopting new forms of activism.
I’m sure I was not alone in this thinking, and I’m sure I am not alone in altering my ways. I’ve met married women and stay-at-home mothers who are intelligent, independent, and as invested in their passion and activism as women without a partner and/or kids.
Their responsibilities at home don’t make them any less ambitious, any less aware of, or any less committed to feminism.
The more time I’ve spent on the internet — and at this point, who hasn’t? — the more I’ve realized how much not having children gets bedazzled to the point to where it diminishes the feminism of women in different economic situations. Think about every article, listicle, or tweet that champions chronic singleness at the expense of relationships or marriages.
Similar to how I glorified single cat ladies, we’re constantly bombarded with (often humorous) internet jokes about loving pets while hating babies, why pizza is better than boys, etc. And as much as I love those memes and understand any joker’s need to cater to the underdog, I can’t help but feeling a little bad for the women who do really, really love children.
It’s unfair to believe they don’t respect themselves as women because of that.
In the spirit of catering to the underdog, I’ll start by really examining myself, my biases and prejudices, and really unpacking five anti-feminist stereotypes I used to harbor about stay-at-home moms — and why they’re wrong:
1. They Are Purposely Unaware Of The Choices Available To Them
Feminism encompasses many aspects, whether it is regarding wage equality, body positivity, better policing against sexual harassment, women’s health — the list goes on. But the common denominator amongst all of this is choice.
Feminism, at its core, advocates the freedom of choice.
Wage equality allows us to choose a career in which we are justly rewarded for the work we put in, thus allowing us to live a balanced life. Positive body image allows us to choose how we want to look without any restrictions.
Efficient policing against sexual harassment is relieving in the knowledge that women are choosing sex that involves consent and mutual respect. Better access to women’s health allows us to choose what is best for our health and bodies.
So if feminism allows us freedom and accessibility, why should it be any different for women who choose to be homemakers?
Stay-at-home mothers aren’t oblivious to feminism — in fact, many of them identify with the movement. They know that they have the freedom to pursue any path they want, and that with any choice will come sacrifice.
For those of us who find our fulfillment through our careers, we are sacrificing time that could be spent with friends or family. For a stay-at-home mother, she’s choosing to raise her children by sacrificing time that could be spent building a career.
If that’s what she believes is best for herself and her family, then her exercising her individual discretion is as feminist as can be.
When a mother is actually unaware and/or restricted from the choices that could and should be available to her, that’s when being a stay-at-home mom turns into a problem for feminism. In this instance, a higher institution of power is confining her to motherhood and forbidding her basic rights such as education. That’s when we need to intervene.
But when we make prejudiced assumptions about people’s choices and awareness, and intervene from that place, we’re actually being assumption.
2. One Woman’s Choice Must Reflect The Choices Of All Women
There’s a very antiquated, survival-focused part of our brains that, in the interest of self-preservation, is quick to make sweeping generalizations about a group of people whose experiences we haven’t been through ourselves.
For example, our country’s legislative body comprised largely of men has still, to this day, done little to nothing about addressing the wage gap due, in large part, because women typically abandon their careers when faced with motherhood. All of this strikes me as laughably ironic, considering women are abandoning careers because of inadequate options to feasibly merge childcare and work.
Of course, this is unfair to all women, whether they want children or not. Motherhood is just one potential aspect of a woman’s life.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/02/feminism-doesnt-care-abt-men/,Anti-Feminists: Stop Using Tragedies to Say Feminists ‘Don’t Care About Important Issues’,"Wondering why feminists “don’t care about” something horrible that’s happening in the world? Before you hit “send” on your complaint about why our silence is the reason you hate feminism, we need to talk.
If the following scenario sounds familiar, this conversation’s for you.
You hear about a man who’s abused by his partner and finds nowhere to turn for help. Or about a white woman who’s gang raped, and her attackers are men of color. Or about starving children on the other side of the globe.
And instead of tragedy, you see opportunity – now’s your chance to prove you’ve been right all along.
You take to feminist pages, racial justice pages, anywhere you can find those “social justice warriors” whose anti-oppressive values bother you. And you bring up what you heard to make your case.
See? Feminists say they want equality, but you get nothing but crickets from them when it’s men who are struggling!
See? Feminists don’t actually care about rape victims – they’re all about making up imaginary “rape culture” to fit their man-hating agenda.
See? Feminists are so busy with first world problems that they don’t care about real suffering!
If any of this sounds familiar, you need to stop and think about what you’re doing before you see the next tragedy as an opportunity to put down feminism and other movements for justice.
As someone who works for a feminist publication and writes about intersectional issues of oppression, I get far too many of these messages. In my writing, I focus primarily on my perspective as a queer Black woman, addressing the issues affecting LGBTQIA+ folks, people of color, and women.
So at this point, I can almost guarantee that if a tragedy in the news affects anyone with the forms of privilege I’ve written about – a white, Western man, for instance – someone’s going to demand to know why I “don’t care.”
If you think I don’t care about justice for all people affected by oppression, including white men, you’re not paying attention.
But I also don’t think this is just a matter of you needing to catch up on my articles. It’s no coincidence that the people who send me these messages aren’t the ones engaging with the issues I do address.
They seem to have no interest in what I’m actually doing to fight for justice – they just want to point out the issues they think I’m neglecting.
What bothers me most is that these messages come across as completely insincere. When you exploit tragedies just to shut down feminism, you’re not doing anything to help the people who are suffering – and you’re trying to stop those of us who actually are taking action to address injustice.
So this is my response – to let you know that I’ve heard your point, and I understand what you’re really saying, and you need to stop. Here’s what you’re itching to say to me about the latest tragedy, and why your message is missing the mark.
1. You Say: ‘You Should Care About These Victims Like I Do!’
What you really mean: “I don’t actually care about these victims – but I’m willing to use them to put you down.”
Some people would just love to catch an activist like me, a Black intersectional feminist, being a “hypocrite” by neglecting the issues I claim to care about.
For instance, since I bring attention to the problem of police brutality against people of color, they insist that means that I don’t care about all victims of violence.
“So I guess you don’t realize how many people died in Chicago last weekend from black on black crime.”
“Why don’t you say that all lives matter? White people get killed by police, too!”
However, it’s not hard to find clear explanations on why the movement is called Black Lives Matter and not all lives matter.
And if you think Black activists aren’t in schools, churches, marches, and risking their lives in direct interventions to stop street violence, then you’re simply not paying attention to the community response to “black on black crime.”
The people sending me these messages spend their time harassing activists on Twitter, not organizing under the banner of “All Lives Matter” to support victims of police violence.
They don’t even realize that rates of “black on black crime” are just like the rates of violence within any other group – and they’re not doing anything about the issue of “white on white” crime.
They’re more likely to riot after a sports game than to protest a police killing.
So if you’re about to grab that statistic from a violent weekend in Chicago to try to prove my activism wrong, stop. Think about how you don’t even know the victims’ names, how you’re not actually recognizing their families’ grief, or listening to their communities’ leaders about what they need.
It’s horribly insensitive to exploit their pain just to seek out activists and start an argument. Consider that they need actual support and healing, not to be a tool in your debate.
2. You Say: ‘This Example Proves Everything About Why Feminists are Wrong’
What you really mean: “I refuse to face the complexities of this issue, so I’m deliberately oversimplifying it.”
If you’re going to take on issues of injustice, you’re going to need to grasp a little thing called nuance.
No intersectional feminist issue can be addressed without recognizing complexity. This means that if you’re going to challenge me on these issues, then at the very least, you’re going to have to acknowledge that complexity, too.
Instead, many people try to discredit feminism by oversimplifying the issues and bringing up individual examples as “proof” that feminists are wrong about everything.
Say you come across a particularly harrowing case of a loving father being denied custody of his children. You point this out to show that courts are biased against men – and point to feminists’ silence on the case to prove that we don’t care about “gender equality” after all.
You’re oversimplifying this issue by focusing on the outcome of fathers being treated unfairly in custody cases, without thinking about the causes that explain why this is happening.
So if you actually want to address the problems with child custody, let’s talk about what’s really going on. About why, while fathers who ask for custody often get it, many fathers don’t request custody of their children.
Let’s talk about the harm of traditional gender norms – how many people still think of men as breadwinners and women as homemakers, often leading to an unequal distribution of domestic work. And how many people believe that biological differences give mothers more of a nurturing instinct than fathers.
If these topics sound familiar, it might be because you came across them when you skimmed the about page of a feminist organization you accused of “not caring” about fathers.
If you approach this conversation without nuance, and by focusing on anecdotal evidence of your anti-feminist views, you’re going to miss how feminists are actually addressing this issue.
Solving the problems with child custody will take some deep culture change around how society puts people in narrow boxes based on their gender. And that’s exactly what feminists are working on.
3. You Say: ‘This Is Why I’m a Humanist/Egalitarian, Not a Feminist’
What you really mean: “I’m not actually going to do anything about this terrible thing. But I’ll criticize you because I think you’re not doing anything either!”
Do you ever see feminists’ silence on an important issue as confirmation that you should be an egalitarian, a humanist, or an “equalist,” but not a feminist?
I have no problem with your identifying as any of these things. But you’re missing the point of feminism if you’re sending messages like: “Men have higher suicide rates than women, so feminism is useless, and that’s why I’m a humanist!”
For one thing, as Jarune Uwajaren explained, “Humanism and feminism are not mutually exclusive and can coexist.”
“Humanism” refers to several branches of philosophical and secular thinking. Egalitarianism is a philosophical belief in equality among people.
It’s possible to believe in “true equality” and also be a feminist – because feminism isn’t only about women.
But the term refers to a political movement for social change. And it’s far from “useless” – feminists have accomplished many victories that benefit people of all genders.
I can’t help but notice when people identify with “humanist” or “equalist” not to be part of a movement that’s actually creating change, but simply to claim that they care more about equality than feminists do.
If you’re not doing anything but using these words to try discrediting a movement that’s creating change, you’re not contributing to building equality.
For instance, men who are victims and survivors of suicide deserve support that focuses on them – not on just using them as weapons against feminism.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/11/rejecting-religious-feminists/,Why We Really Need to Stop Rejecting Religious Feminists from the Movement,"Originally published on The Huffington Post and republished here with the authors’ permission.
It seems like every few weeks another young, female celebrity proudly and publicly declares she is not a feminist: Shailene Woodley. Katy Perry. Kelly Clarkson. Kendall Jenner.
These women often justify their refusal to claim feminism by explaining they do not hate men – speaking to the most intractable and yawn-worthy of the mischaracterizations of feminism – or by insisting they do not personally face inequality.
Nevermind that compelling movie roles for women dry up decades before those for men, or that recently 37-year-old Maggie Gyllenhaal was deemed “too old” to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man. (Thank you, Amy Schumer, for the Last F**kable Day Skit!)
Even if we accept these young stars’ claims that they don’t face any discrimination, feminists wonder where the concern is for other, less privileged women.
This question is both frustrating and justifiable.
On the one hand, who cares what a reality television star thinks of feminism? On the other, these women tremendous power to influence young women. For them to dismissively say, “I have rights, so who needs feminism?” both dishonors the sacrifices of our foremothers and ignores the reality that women’s rights are still in play.
They are still in play for women seeking equal pay for equal work, for those who want paid maternity leave, and for those who seek access to reproductive health. They are still in play for women of color and for LGBTQIA+ women.
And they are still in play for women of faith.
Gender continues to be a serious issue in patriarchal religious traditions, and women continue to be denied particular roles because of their gender.
However, while mainstream feminists practically beg young celebrities to adopt the “feminist” label, women of faith are mocked for actually claiming a feminist identity and working within our traditions to combat sexism.
So why have we become second-class feminists?
We understand the appearance of a disconnect between our faith and our feminism. We acknowledge that our religious traditions suffer from sexist interpretations. We understand why some feminists leave our faiths, and we have been tempted to do the same.",feminism

http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/02/need-white-women-level-up-feminism/,5 Ways I Need White Women to Level Up Feminism Right Now,"(Content Warning: racist quotes, mention of anti-trans language)
The day of the Women’s March on Washington, my social media lit up with pictures of friends, students, and community members taking to the streets.
That day, millions of people marched to protest the inauguration and presidency of Donald J Trump. Even my mom sent me a hella cute text declaring herself a part of the sisterhood.
But while there was some beautiful solidarity, many divisions remain between white women and women of color.
There’s an ugly history of oppression within “Women’s Liberation” and the “Feminist Movement” that we must acknowledge before we can approach any meaningful alliance.
Thinkpiece after thinkpiece after thinkpiece explained why so many people of color refused to march on January 21st.
They raise point after valid point about racism within mainstream feminism.
Many of these writers reflect a desire for the movement to be more inclusive, to be more aware of its racial fault lines, and to be more of a coalition.
If anyone is out there reading this and saying “that sounds hard,” that’s because it is.
Black feminist Bernice Johnson Reagon once said that true coalition would make you feel as though you were “gonna keel over any minute and die…threatened to the core.” Indeed, coalition requires facing some hard truths about racism, transmisogyny, and cultural appropriation in the feminist movement.
Moreover, it involves action to mend feminism where it’s fallen by the wayside.
So here’s a consolidated list of steps for those white feminists who have read the critiques, raised their own awareness, and acknowledged their privilege.
Here’s what to do next.
1. Push Past Your Pride and Acknowledge Your Racism
Carrie Chapman Catt said,“White supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by women’s suffrage.”
Elizabeth Cady Stanton said, “What will we and our daughters suffer if these degraded black men…have the rights that would make them even worse than our Saxon fathers?”
I begin with these blatantly racist quotes because they give rise to one of – if not the greatest – challenge many organizers have faced historically and today when it comes to solidarity with white feminists: racism. These two quotes were not from rank-and-file suffragettes, but from founders of feminism.
Racism is perhaps the most obvious reason so many women and people of color keep two hands out for distance when it comes to mainstream feminism.
Despite studying feminism throughout college, I was years into my PhD before I learned the history of women of color feminists.
For instance, four short years ago, I learned that Native women of the Seneca nation taught Lucretia Mott about governmental structure and decision-making before she traveled to Seneca Falls, where she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton held the world’s first women’s rights convention.
The erasure of our labor and explicit white supremacy from white feminists persists in highly visible feminists like Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham whose “casual racism” invites not only divisiveness, but rancor.
In the this tweet, Schumer illustrates a repeated (and woefully common) willingness to demonize and criminalize men of color as needed to unite white women behind the fiction of the Black/Brown brute.
I need white feminists to acknowledge that they’re inviting people of color into a movement that has historically appropriated our labor and perpetuated white supremacy.
Recognizing that fact will go a long way in healing the divide between us.
2. Move Outside of Your Comfort Zones and Show Up
If you are able and have the capacity, now is the time to show up with your signs, your voices, and your bodies.
I live in a city where I see the same people at every single action. They’re at every bridge shut down. They chain themselves to every building. They’re at every town hall meeting.
We joke they’re the mayors of the town.
Unsurprisingly, they’re tired. They have day jobs, but their commitment to just being physically present is unrivaled.
I’m not saying you suddenly need to become the quintessential activist (such a thing doesn’t exist) or attend every organizing meeting. I actually discourage this because burnout is real. But by simply showing up, you are supporting anti-oppression in all its myriad forms.
Last month, thousands of people – many of them new to movement work – went to their second protest ever.
And do you know what happened?
All the detainees at airports in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco were released.
If this new outpouring of enthusiastic support continued to fight for women’s rights, but also for the rights of Muslims, LGBTQIA+ folks, Native, and Black communities, we could change the face of oppression.
So show up however you can.
Open your wallet and donate. If you work in tech, learn how to help us protect ourselves with cyber security. Or do any of these 26 things.
I do believe that we will win, but only if a lot of us take the time to show the fuck up.

For more information on why it is important to avoid bi+ erasure, please check out these articles: 1 2 3)
I came out and of age in the feminist movement, which means that I have done a lot of work alongside straight women – a lot of which has centered around bringing people into the movement, educating folks about what feminism is, dispelling myths about what it isn’t, and doing modern-day consciousness raising to get more people involved on a global level.
And it’s in those feminist recruitment spaces that I find that many well-intentioned, totally awesome, usually straight colleagues pull out an old and tired line we’re all familiar with: “We’re not all lesbians!”
Unfortunately, many of the myths about feminism that scare people away are more concerned with who feminists are than what we do or believe in.
People are worried we’re all bra-burning, man-hating, witchcraft-practicing lesbians who refuse to shave and don’t give a damn about looking good.
To which I say: So what if we are?
If all feminists were queer women with unshaved legs who embraced their bodies regardless of what they looked like and gathered in the woods to cast spells, I wouldn’t give a damn. Because none of that matters!
Some feminists are thin and some are fat. Some are queer and some are straight. Some shave and some don’t.
None of that changes what feminism is truly about: building space, and ultimately, an entire planet, in which all women are safe – no matter who they are.
And that’s why when we tell people we’re not all fat and we’re not all ugly and we’re not all lesbians – even though we know that having people of different sizes, appearances, and sexualities in the movement doesn’t matter, and actually makes it stronger – we’re doing it a huge disservice.
Feminism is a movement that’s based in breaking norms.
It’s often perceived as being, first and foremost, about breaking gender norms. Feminism rejects the idea that women should only be housewives and caretakers. Feminism rejects a gender binary that pits women against men, and then renders them subordinate. And feminism rejects the idea that there is any part of our genders or sexualities that should be dictated by other people’s expectations.
But feminism is also about breaking other norms, and often challenging the oppressive roots of our own cultures directly.
Feminism is a movement that declares that economic justice is tied to liberation. It’s a movement that challenges itself to be more inclusive of women of color, queer women, trans women, and agender and gender non-conforming people.
It’s a globally minded movement that amplifies the voices of people around the world who are advocating for themselves against patriarchy.
No, we’re not all lesbians. But some of us are. That’s one of the things that makes up the fabric of the modern-day feminist movement and shapes its direction. And that’s why proudly telling people “we’re not all lesbians” isn’t okay.
When we apologize for the things that make feminism radical or the aspects of our community and movement that smash normative ideas, we misrepresent what we’re all about.
These three things are what you’re really saying when you tell people feminists “aren’t all lesbians.” And they’re three reasons you shouldn’t say it anymore.
1. It Defines Feminism by Oppressive Standards of Normality
When we talk about the norm, we’re talking about a series of hurtful and oppressive social structures that maintain imbalances of power.
The norm is patriarchy, white supremacy, classism, heterosexism, cissexism, and a slew of other systems of privilege all wrapped up into one tiny phrase.
We’re brought up in a culture that tries to push that norm onto us – and one of the main goals of feminism is smashing that norm and replacing it with societal ideas that are more fair, equal, and balanced.
It’s societal norms that tell us women should be homemakers and mothers, and nothing more. It’s societal norms that tell us women should do all they can to please and attract men, and then define themselves in relation to those men.
It’s societal norms that tell us cis, thin, white women are the ideal – and that women of color and trans women are lesser than them. It’s societal norms that shame poor women. It’s societal norms that shame single moms.
And it’s societal norms that define queer women – and lesbians in particular – as unattractive, broken people who failed to fit into that rigid set of expectations.
As feminists, we should know better than to believe in those norms.
We should recognize and remember that queer women have been major players in the feminist movement. We should hold in reverence that they have redefined and challenged dominant feminist discourse, and broadened the scope of what women’s empowerment looked like in the process.
We should know that queer women, like other women who live at the intersections of oppression, are an asset to the feminist movement – and an important part of its life and trajectory.
And we shouldn’t apologize for it.
But that’s what we’re doing when we tell people we’re not all lesbians. When we say that, we’re caving to those norms.
We’re trying to make feminism more palatable and attractive, and we’re doing so by selling out some of our sisters.
In saying it, we are, in effect, incorrectly defining our own movement. Because even though we aren’t all lesbians, we are a movement that also understands and must stand for the idea that there’s nothing wrong with the fact that some of us are.
When we apologize for queer feminists, we’re communicating that we, in some way, stand for all those societal norms that hurt all women, and all people.
And that just ain’t right.
2. Because It Isolates (And Shames) Queer Feminists
Take it from me: When you’re queer and you hear someone apologizing for your identity, it doesn’t feel good.
This year, Bisexual Awareness Day/Celebrate Bisexuality Day was on September 23rd.
That same day, the National LGBTQ Task Force thought it’d be a good idea to post an article entitled “Bye Bye Bi, Hello Queer,” in which leadership programs director Evangeline Weiss said “she is ready ‘to say bye bye to the word bisexuality.’
She said it does not describe her sexual orientation, and she encouraged readers to cease using the word as well as she felt it reinforced a binary concept of gender.
Let me drive that home a little more. The National LGBTQ Task Force not only thought it would be a good idea to publish an article insulting, misrepresenting, and forsaking the bisexual letter in their own name, but did so on Celebrate Bisexuality Day.
Rude.
And a fantastic example of the constant, ongoing erasure bisexual people have to deal with. This one just happened to be incredibly blatant.
What happened as a result of that article? People got pissed.
People got so pissed that the Task Force not only removed the article from their website, but posted in its place this non-apology (it keeps being referred to as an apology, but I’m not so easily pleased): “Having listened to a wide array of feedback on the timing and content, we recognize that this blog offended people. For this we sincerely apologize. It has been removed.”
In other words, “Sorry you got pissed off. Hopefully you’ll shut up if we take it down.” Which, as far as I can tell, isn’t much of an apology for a blatant disregard of an entire community of people.
Misunderstanding of the bisexual community has been the crux of biphobia’s history and the ongoing battle to erase bisexuality from the LGBTQIA+ community.
It’s a scary time to be bi, especially when your lesbian, gay, pansexual, and queer siblings and allies are calling for your blood simply because they’ve fallen victim to the mainstream agenda without realizing it. (Say what?! Jump to #5.)
It’s time for a change.
It’s time for all of us to properly understand one another and to — hope of hopes — become allies for our incredibly similar endeavors. To help initiate that friendship, I ask you, dear reader, to go through the following three steps.
Step 1: Look below. If I’ve played my cards right, virtually every reader should find at least one category with which they identify.
Step 2: Approach your designated section(s) with an open mind, an unprejudiced heart, and a desire to further enhance your own community/ies. It’s difficult for people to learn new things and see different views if they automatically approach them with resistance, which is often the case with bisexual topics.
Step 3: See how bi erasure hurts you as a person and, while you’re at it, likely hurts the people you care about. Because it really is happening.
So here are five ways in which bi erasure is hurting people of layered identities.
1. Female-Identified People and Feminists
Bisexuality is one of the only non-monosexual* identities currently recognized in the English-speaking world. If bisexuality is kept underground, it suppresses our limited, precious resources for open discussion about non-monosexuality. This hurts female-identified people and feminists regardless of their sexual orientation.
To this day, female-identified people can’t get a fair shake. Pay is unequal, birth control access is limited, and objectification is a daily thing. Non-monosexual women in particular are often not taken seriously because they’re seen as sluts, greedy, or unable to make up their minds.
Also, the general fetishizing of women is particularly intensified in the bisexual realm by (straight-identified) men, turning the very act of women’s sexual freedom, empowerment, and self-expression into nothing more than something for male gazes. (This is most often seen through the relentless prompts for female-female-male threesomes and masculine catcalls in bars when two femme-appearing women make out.)
By participating in or casually allowing bi erasure to happen, we’re ignoring the specific plights and abuses of bisexual women, thereby contributing to the ongoing problem of female inequality, objectification, and silence.
As feminists, we can’t pick and choose which women to fight for. The complexities of womanhood — and all of its cultural suppressions — are an all-or-none deal.
*Note: Non-monosexuality usually refers to someone who is interested in more than one sex or gender. (In other words, somebody who isn’t gay, lesbian, or straight.) Another way to say “non-monosexuality” would be “polysexuality” to help keep it from sounding negative.
2. Male-Identified People and Male Liberationists*
Just like with female-identified people and feminists, bi erasure hurts male-identified people and male liberationists regardless of their sexual orientation.
Allow me to make this pretty basic: Men continue to be fed the message that being gay is bad. Being gay means you’re not really a man, which means you lose your dude membership and the bulk of your male privilege. And since gayness equals the slightest shred of attraction to or intimacy with another male, all manners of bromance must be squashed.
In short, many guys live in a state of silent terror in this regard.
Bi men are afraid of being banished from the world of lady-loving, gay men are worried about losing all of their connections to hetero land, and nothing is worse for a straight man than being called a fag.
Constant monitoring, constant filtering, constant stress: Is this really the kind of world we guys want to keep living in?
By being able to talk about bisexuality — remember: one of our only non-monosexual identities — male-identified people can begin to break free from the masculine ideal.
Bi talk helps bridge the gap between being a man (straight) and not being a man (gay) and realizing, hey, having some manner of attraction to or intimate interaction with another guy is totally okay, masculinity unscathed.
Gay men can begin to regain their identities as men, bi men can finally start coming out, and “fag” will lose its strength as an insult from one straight man to another.
*Note: Male liberationists are more or less seen as allies to feminists and vice versa. Both will argue that patriarchy is bad, but while feminists talk of how it’s bad for females, male liberationists talk of how it’s bad for males. Examples include the inability to romantically or sexually love another male, the emasculation of men of color, and the physical, verbal, and mental abuse that comes from society’s expectations to be stereotypically masculine.

http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/11/foodie-without-appropriation/,The Feminist Guide to Being a Foodie Without Being Culturally Appropriative,"“The dishes of America’s recent immigrants have become check marks on a cultural scavenger hunt for society’s elite.” —Ruth Tam
I watch a lot of competitive cooking shows. And it seems like whenever there is a “bizarre” or “exotic” cooking ingredient, it’s associated with foods from my culture and childhood. 100 year old egg. Duck bills. Stinky tofu.
Mainstream media has made a spectacle out of foods from seemingly exotic places.
I’ve also observed a lot of White chefs create “Asian-inspired” dishes. When going out to eat, I notice many “Asian-fusion” themed restaurants where chefs combine all the countries and flavors in the vast and diverse continent of Asia and throw them together on both plate and menu.
What is “Asian inspired” or “Asian-fusion?” I have a sinking suspicion it’s not like when my mom made me sushi with cucumbers, lunch meat, and eggs growing up. Or toast with mayonnaise and pork sung. People used to make fun of the food I eat, and now suddenly, stuff like spam fried rice is selling at a hip new restaurant for $16.
It’s frustrating when my culture gets consumed and appropriated as both trend and tourism.
When it comes to food, what’s appropriation and what’s not can be tricky to think about.
Cultural appropriation is when members of a dominant culture adopt parts of another culture from people that they’ve also systematically oppressed. The dominant culture can try the food and love the food without ever having to experience oppression because of their consumption.
With food, it isn’t just eating food from someone else’s culture. It might not be appropriation if you’re White and you love eating dumplings and hand pulled noodles. Enjoying food from another culture is perfectly fine.
But, food is appropriated when people from the dominant culture – in the case of the US, white folks – start to fetishize or commercialize it, and when they hoard access to that particular food.
When a dominant culture reduces another community to its cuisine, subsumes histories and stories into menu items – when people think culture can seemingly be understood with a bite of food, that’s where it gets problematic.
It’s also harmful when the dominant culture controls the economic and material resources to produce that food for their own consumption and profit.
Here are some dining behaviors that are culturally appropriative when it comes to food.
1. Seeking ‘Authentic’ and ‘Exotic’ ‘Ethnic’ Food
Often, when we talk about “ethnic” food, we’re not referring to French, German, or Italian cuisine, and definitely not those Ikea Swedish meatballs.
Usually, we re talking about Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, Ethiopian, and Mexican food –places where food is cooked by the “brownest” people.
While food from Western Europe is still connected to ethnic roots, ethnic food has become reserved only for ethnicities that are perceived as exotic and foreign to White folks.
While food can connect people together and also serve as a way to learn about cultures other than our own, what happens is that food becomes the only identifier for certain places. Japan reduced to ramen and sushi, Mexico reduced to tacos and burritos, India reduced to curry, and so on.
Entire regions become deduced to menu options and ingredients without any thought to the many different communities in these places. There’s a loss of complexity and cultures end up getting homogenized.
In seeking “authentic” food, we’re hoping for a truly immersive experience into another culture. The food experience, whether in a restaurant in someone’s home city or as part of a trip somewhere else, comes to represent a larger experience with that culture and community. Our perceptions of what is “authentic” stem from pre-conceived “exotic narratives” of that culture and communities.
“Oh, during my trip to Asia, I had the most authentic [fill in the blank].”
Food culture has travelled and flowed in messy and complicated ways across the globe.
The impacts of historical and ongoing colonization are devastating to many cultures, and many “authentic” “ethnic” cuisines are connected to histories of colonization.
For example, what is now Vietnam had been occupied by China for a thousand years and then colonized by France. This period of colonization is also what led to things like banh mi (sandwiches) and banh ex (crepes). The use of spam in different parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands, like spam musubi or spam in hot pot, are a direct result of US colonization.
If you love a dish and think it’s delicious, great! If you’re searching for a place that serves a particular dish, also great!
However, seeking “authenticity” fetishizes the sustenance of another culture. The idea of the “authentic” food experience is separated from reality. It also freezes a culture in a particular place in time.
2. Having Your Friend of Color Be Your Food Expert
Don’t get me wrong, I love sharing foods from my culture with friends. I also love helping friends with restaurant recommendations and spending a long time on Yelp! trying to find good options for a group to go.
Where I take issue is when I become someone’s food ambassador to all of Asia.
Some friends have expected me to know where to get ramen, “real” Chinese food, “street-style” Thai food, Korean BBQ – and they’re disappointed when I don’t know. These are also the friends that once made fun of my food.
As someone who straddles different cultural identities, as Taiwanese and American, my knowledge of my culture comes from my parents and my personal experiences growing up.
My experiences of Taiwanese food are mostly from following my parents around, and because my language skills are rudimentary, I can never find the restaurant we went to or order the same things they did again.
There’s also a lot I don’t know about other Asian cultures, about the complex relationships and power dynamics between Asian countries. There’s a lot that I’m still learning, too. I do my own research on places to check out and you can too.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/05/live-feminist-relationship-rules/,50 Liberating Relationship ‘Rules’ for Feminists to Live By,"Back when I used dating apps, the word “feminist” appeared on my profiles. And that’s how I learned how many people have a bone to pick with feminism.
My inbox filled with messages like: “Do you not like boys?” What if I told you I was a masculinist?” “Feminism ignores the oppression that’s been imposed on men for centuries.”
I ended up on dates with seemingly progressive people who made comments like “well, men do have spatial skills” and “but hijabs are oppressive.”
People told me I shouldn’t be too picky. They said I was splitting hairs by reconsidering relationships over things like this.
When a guy groped me in a park on a first date, a friend recommended I give him a chance because it could’ve been a misunderstanding. When a boyfriend ignored my complaints about pain during sex and kept going, a therapist told me that men can’t help themselves.
So, I settled. A lot. I ignored my nagging feeling that I wasn’t getting what I wanted, believing that would be too much to ask.
After a few years, I got tired of it. I decided that if being in a relationship required hiding my feminism and putting up with sexism, I’d rather just be single.
So, I spent a year deprioritizing dating and focusing on my career. I worked through the fear that being single made me inadequate and got comfortable with it.
When I met my current partner, I decided I’d rather risk things not working out over my feminism than compromise it. I told him feminism was important to me in the beginning, and I made a promise to look out for myself and not put up with certain things.
If you don’t follow the same rules, that doesn’t make you a bad feminist. There are many reasons someone might not have that privilege. Someone might stay with an abusive partner, for example, because they’re financially dependent on them or have been threatened by them.
ButI’ve pledged to follow these rules to stay true to my feminism while dating whenever I safely and comfortably can.
1. I won’t hide my feminism to get someone to like me. If they have a problem with it, I don’t want to date them anyway.
2. I won’t buy into the myth that I do or don’t “deserve” certain people due to my looks, my class, or my achievements.
3. I won’t feel obligated to have sex with someone just because they’re expecting it.
4. I won’t feel obligated to date someone just because they’re “nice.”
5. I won’t feel obligated to talk to someone just because they really, really want me to.
6. I’ll disappoint people if that’s what it takes to guard my boundaries.
7. If someone violates my boundaries, I won’t wonder what I did to “lead them on.”
8. I’ll ignore advice that diminishes my self-worth, victim-blames me, or encourages me to settle.
9. I’ll keep people who routinely say negative things about oppressed groups at a distance, and I won’t feel bad about it.
10. I’ll respectfully question loved ones’ sexist, racist, or otherwise oppressive word choices or assumptions. And I’ll with the belief that they want to be better allies but just don’t know how and the intention to help them.
11. I won’t let anyone convince me I’m “too sensitive” for suffering when others suffer, “angry” for caring about “small” injustices, or “closed-minded” for opposing others’ decisions just because they don’t personally feel the same way.
12. I won’t change my beliefs just because the majority of people around me believe otherwise.
13. I won’t apologize for voicing my discontent to my partner.
14. I won’t let my partner make me forget what I think.
15. I won’t internalize my partner’s beliefs about me if I don’t agree with them.
16. If I’m not enjoying sex, I’ll stop.
17. If I’m unsure of something my partner wants to do, I’ll say “no,” knowing I can change my mind.
18. I’ll never say “okay” when I mean “maybe,” or “maybe” when I mean “no.”
19. I’ll only date feminists.
20. I’ll dump anyone who tries to convince me that feminism is worthless or sexism isn’t real.
21. I won’t feel obligated to hang out with a partner’s misogynistic, racist, or intolerant friends or family.
22. I won’t keep quiet about my activism, shave my body hair, or do anything else to tone myself down to fit in with my partner’s friends or family.
23. I won’t buy into the myth that I’m “high-maintenance” or “a lot to handle” for ensuring my emotional needs are met.
24. I’ll demand courtesy, communication, and thoughtfulness about consent from even my most casual sexual partners.
25. I won’t have sex just to prove I’m liberated.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/04/anti-feminism-hurts-all-genders/,3 Ways Anti-Feminism Hurts People of All Genders,"Earlier this year, I was teaching my college human sexuality class.
The topic of the day was legislation surrounding reproductive health, and as I was getting sorted, pulling up my slides, and handing out an attendance sheet, I overheard part of a conversation between some of my students.
One of them had arrived wearing a shirt that read “feminist” across the chest, and another student said to her, “I like your shirt, but I don’t call myself a feminist since I support rights for everyone. I like humanist better.”
Then a third chimed in, “Me, too. Or equalist because I don’t think women are better than men.”
Now, I didn’t get the sense than any of these folks were actively anti-feminist. But in the course of my semi-eavesdropping, it did become clear that there was a lot of misunderstanding about what feminism is and what it isn’t. Who it benefits, and whom it is assumed to harm.
So just to clear things up, it is important to realize that at its core, feminism isn’t about supposing that any a/gender is superior to any other.
Nor is it a movement designed to advance the rights of one group at the expense of another.
Really, the underlying goal of feminism is to dismantle all manifestations of gender-based oppression, something that many feminists know has to be done in tandem with fighting discrimination in its myriad forms.
But due to a complicated combination of blatant misogyny, plain old misunderstanding, and various missteps within the feminist movement, a lot of people don’t realize how feminism can benefit people of all a/genders.
And the idea that anti-feminism actually harms people of all a/genders, including men? Well, that’s still hard for a lot of folks to understand.
With that in mind, here’s what you should know to help sort this all out.
1. Patriarchy Hurts Everyone
Though individuals may hold patriarchal ideas, when we talk about “the patriarchy,” we aren’t putting responsibility on any one person.
Rather, we’re referring to an unjust social system that enforces rigidly divided gender roles, and in doing so oppresses people of all a/genders. This system is often made up of social, political, and/or economic mechanisms that promote cis male dominance over all other a/genders.
One of the most prominent voices to challenge the forces of patriarchy is feminist scholar bell hooks who has been writing and teaching about radical social issues since the 1970s.
hooks has explained patriarchy as:
A political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.
This view of the patriarchy does not implicate lone men. Rather, it positions men, too, as victims of an oppressive system.
And how are they victimized? In countless ways.
For example, since patriarchal societies tell men they’re expected to be sex-driven, violent, dominant, and emotionless, when they don’t live up to these rigid expectations, they’re punished from a shockingly early age.
Just think about all toddlers who are told that “boys don’t cry.” And then think about how these kids grow up assuming toxic masculinity is the only way to protect themselves against one of patriarchy’s favorite strategies: the constant reminder that there’s nothing worse than being perceived as feminine.
At first glance, it might seem like a/gender minorities are the sole victims of patriarchal thinking. But when we dig just a little deeper, it becomes clear that this is far from the case.
2. The Foundation of Anti-Feminism Is Often Misaligned with People’s Actual Values
There have always been people who will denounce efforts to help evolve our understanding of gender roles and who are against expanding rights to traditionally marginalized groups.
For example, there was opposition to women’s suffrage, there was opposition to the birth control pill, and there remains opposition to the fight for basic human rights for people of all a/gender identities and sexual orientations.
But the origins of the modern anti-feminist movement generally emerged out of specific opposition to legal abortion and to the – Oh my god! How has this still not passed? – Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).
Originally, these two hot-button issues were fought on conservative, religious grounds. But it didn’t take long for these sentiments to grow into something of a full on anti-feminist movement.
Now, in a country that is increasingly secular, it would stand to reason that many folks might take issue with the religious rationale for such views. However, in the anti-feminist circles, this doesn’t seem to happen a lot.
Partly because it’s common to pick and choose from religion as it suits you. Often that works out just fine.
Other times – say, like when you only use religion to justify your right to oppress someone else (as slave owners did back in the day, or as folks tend to do currently when trying to challenge the rights of a whole range of marginalized people) – not so much.
Today, a lot of the anti-feminism hype is coming from individuals calling themselves “men’s rights activists.”
These people may argue that things like custody laws and child support requirements are unfair to men. They often seem to believe that there is a feminist-led conspiracy to falsely accuse them of rape.
And they tend to cite an imagined history where incredibly traditional gender roles resulted in harmony and prosperity, if not for all, at least for the white men many of these fellas claim to represent.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/09/taylor-swift-white-feminism/,5 Ways Taylor Swift Exemplifies White Feminism – And Why That’s a Problem,"Make no mistake: I love Taylor Swift.
“I Knew You Were Trouble” is one of my favorite shower songs, I’ve cried incessantly to “All Too Well” after a breakup (and, um, every time I hear it), and I could kick your ass at “We Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together” karaoke.
By far, she’s my problematic fave.
But goddamn, is she ever problematic.
And as much as I appreciate a pop artist that I love donning the feminist label, I really hate when they do so in the name of the special brand of fucked-up anti-oppression work known as White Feminism.
Now, White Feminism, for those of you who may not be aware, is not a pejorative term coined to describe all feminists that happen to be white.
Rather, White Feminism refers to the practicing of a feminism that assumes white (cis, straight, able-bodied, thin, middle-to-upper class) women as the default, actively avoiding critical analysis on any axis other than gender, thereby leading to a cookie-cutter feminism that can only possibly be useful to those it’s intended for: white women.
And that’s a problem.
And as much as I’m a Swifty, I’m a feminist first (and a white one, at that), and I’m not here for any kind of feminism that would excuse, for instance, Taylor’s misunderstanding that race is irrelevant in pop culture politics (a la the feud with Nicki Minaj that never was).
So for those of you still confused about how Taylor’s version of feminism is too, um, white to be useful, here are five examples from each of the videos that she’s released in tandem with her singles off of her latest album, 1989.
1. Shake It Off
Also known as: “Women of Color Sure Can Shake It”
Taylor, people may argue you’ve got nothing in your brain (that’s what people say, mmm mmm), and I would debate with them for sure. You’re smart and savvy, and you know exactly what you’re doing — which is why the world was unsurprised by both your cultural appropriation and objectification of women of color in this video.
Sure, many people have argued that, perhaps, the video isn’t appropriative or objectifying, since the scenes in question (see: break dancing in a hoodie, fitted cap, and boom box; see also: twerking in short shorts and a load of jewelry) follow the same script as the rest of the video: Taylor not quite fitting in and finding herself in awe of the (more talented) dancers who surround her.
And I get that argument. Because the same joke runs throughout the video.
The question, really, is this: Taylor, is hip-hop really yours to joke about?
And when you present an image of your squeaky clean, desexualized-by-way-of-assumed-purity self literally crawling under the asses of women of color, and then laughing off how impossible it would be for you to emulate something so sexualized by the male gaze, who’s the joke on, really, when you still reign triumphant (albeit awkwardly) by the end of the video?
Because there’s a huge difference between appreciating and exchanging cultureand straight-up trying it on for size and then shedding it at the end of the day when that benefits you. The latter is appropriative, and it is always, always, always harmful.
2. Blank Space
Also known as: “Intimate Partner Violence Is Cute and Amusing in Some Contexts”
For the most part, I really enjoy “Blank Space” — both as a song and a video. While I wouldn’t go as far as to suggest that in it, she’s “the woman we’ve been waiting for,” I most definitely do appreciate Taylor’s jab at media portrayals of herself.
About the inspiration for the song, Taylor explains that “there’s been a sort of sensational fictionalization of [her] personal life,” whereby the media paints her as “a serial dater” who “can’t keep [her love interests] because she’s too emotional and she’s needy.” And when the relationship ends? “She goes to her evil lair and writes songs about it for revenge.”
High five, Taylor Swift, for joking on that bullshit. And the song is catchy as hell. Right away, it was one of my favorites on the album.
But then the video dropped, and I was kinda like, “Um…”
Because although we can say plenty of great things about it, there’s one huge problem: It trivializes dating violence. In fact, it kinda makes it look sexy.
The entire video, with the lyrics set against it, is a story about entrapping men in a fantasy world with lavish gifts and activities, only to keep them by means of what can only be described as abuse.
She drops his phone into a pool when she assumes that he’s cheating. She goes on a rampage — “screaming, crying, perfect storms” — where she yells at and then pushes him. She falls apart crying, taking on the “This is all your fault,” victim-blaming role. And then she threatens him with a knife not to leave, sets his clothes on fire, possibly attempts to poison him, and smashes his car.
If the tables were turned and this was a video where a man was doing this to a woman — even under the guise of a joke — no one would call it feminist or progressive.
It’s scary as all hell.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/10/feminism-and-yoga/,What’s So Feminist About Yoga? Here Are 4 Amazing Connections,"Yoga is not feminist.
Or that’s what you might think if you only know yoga through the lens of our capitalist, body-shaming, fitness-obsessed American culture.
Seeing magazine covers of thin, wealthy, White, cis women talking about “how to get yoga abs” certainly isn’t appealing for those of us working to eradicate inequality and oppression – nor does it make us want to give the practice a try.
The historical and contemporary colonization process of Western yoga serves to whitewash and erase yoga’s South Asian roots, while privileging the voices and bodies of White (heterosexual, cisgender, and wealthy) Americans as the owners, purveyors, and consumers of yoga.
This is certainly not feminist. Heterosexism, cultural appropriation, racism, inaccessibility, profit-driving, gender policing, and body shaming are not feminist values; in fact, recognizing and fighting against them are a necessary part of an intersectional feminist movement. And yet, these are all very present elements of yoga in America today.
They’re also completely counter to the values of the practice.
Feminism and yoga are in no way contradictory. In fact, despite all of this, I would argue that yoga and feminism are authentically bound. Despite the destruction that Western patriarchal capitalism has had on yoga practice and culture, yoga holds subversive, feminist elements that can strengthen our movement.
So what role can yoga play in the feminist movement? How does yoga challenge capitalism and systemic oppression, or strengthen our ability to be agents of social change?
What is so feminist about yoga?
Here are four things to consider.
1. Yoga Changes Our Relationships to Our Bodies
“By being physical without a focus on weight-loss or competition, yoga can help you become a witness to negative self-talk that comes from years of misguided influence of the media and other cultural forces. Despite what Instagram might look like, yoga can help you reject attachment to cultural beauty standards so that you can feel comfortable in your own skin.” —Veronica Rottman, feminist yoga instructor and doula
Although yoga has only in the last several decades begun to occupy a visible place in the American mainstream, yoga has been practiced globally for over 5,000 years. The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit root “yuj” meaning “to yoke,” or “to come together,” “to unite.”
The union of the mind and body is at the core of yoga and is certainly no small goal. We tend to view the mind and body as separate things in our culture, and we promote division by prioritizing one over the other.
Certainly, living under an endless amount of body-shaming, victim-blaming, and social pressures around sex and body image creates a context for toxic relationships with our bodies.
Feminism takes up this cause by examining, deconstructing, and challenging these norms. Yoga takes up the cause through the practice of embodiment. This process means connecting and reconnecting and coming into our bodies just by noticing what we’re feeling without judgment or any attempt to control or change those physical and emotional experiences.
Our bodies hold our life stories. They hold our grief and trauma, our anxiety, our sadness, our joy, our histories. And while we live in an incredibly cognitive world, we can’t always verbally explain what’s happened and is happening in our bodies. In fact, most of the time, we don’t even notice or care. The division of our “self” from our bodies allows the space for constant negative self-talk, criticism, and punishment of our bodies for just being what they are.
In a world that teaches us to constantly try to “take control” over ourselves – our bodies, our weight, our health, our emotions – it can be a radically feminist experience to learn to simply hold the space for our bodies to feel whatever sensations arise, to allow ourselves to carry what our bodies want to hold onto, to let go of what they no longer need, to breathe in their history and each passing moment.
This is what yoga teaches – to be in our bodies, fully, and to love the movement and sensations and emotions, with all their complexity.
2. Yoga Can Help Us Heal From Trauma
“Feminism offered the ideological tools to examine my tortured relationship with my body systematically and deconstruct mediated images. Yoga provided the practice that rooted the things feminism had taught me. It is one thing to intellectualize self-love and acceptance, it’s another to embody it.” —Melanie Klein, academic, feminist, yoga instructor
To live in this world as a person of marginalized identities is to experience trauma.
As I’ve discussed in past posts, oppression is immensely bad for your mental health. Healing from the systemic and interpersonal violence that one endures in this world, then, must hold a central role in our movement.
We cannot build a movement of strength without acknowledging the daily trauma (big T and little t) that has been carried out in the name of white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism, and other systems of oppression.
When it comes to healing from trauma, both yoga and feminism play important and overlapping roles. While feminism gives us the framework for letting go of internalized shame, yoga grounds that healing in our bodies.
Increasing research shows that because we hold trauma in our bodies, yoga often gives us the tools we need to release it, to let go of the weight and conditioning and to find a new strength for moving through the world.
This process of healing and building strength and power is such a central part of our work. To be a part of this movement is to acknowledge the trauma inherent in living under and alongside rape culture, police violence in Black communities, violence against abortion providers, the prison industrial complex, gender and sexuality-based hate crimes, and the list goes on and on.
We are witnesses to this trauma, and we are survivors of it. The practice of being present to it, to being awake, and to healing are central to yoga, and central to our social justice work.
The practice of yoga is not only healing – its philosophy also speaks to our social justice goals: The ultimate goal of yoga is liberation.
Yogic philosophy also holds values such as ahimsa, or nonviolence, and kharma, or selfless action, at its core. Yoga, like feminism, seeks to dismantle and deconstruct cultural notions and belief systems through critical thinking, or kind questioning.
It values non-duality and fluidity of the self and in our expression of gender. The idea of “wiping the fog from the mirror” is a common one in yoga – that we can wipe away that which clouds our clarity, that we can be increasingly conscious and awake to what is happening around us.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/08/reasons-to-beware-feminist-men/,Beware These 10 Types of Feminist Men,"Never is a man so potentially dangerous to a female-read person as when he claims to be a feminist.
But this is not an opinion that will endear you to many feminists, even other women. “How can you alienate your own allies?” they say. “How perfect do you really expect them to be?” they say. “Why are you so distrustful? How jaded can you be?”
But especially in dating as a feminist woman who seeks romantic and sexual relationships with men, it’s a necessity. It’s a question that needs to be asked. It’s a suspicion well-advised.
Male feminists are not immune to their masculine socialization – which is categorically toxic. They’re supposed to seek to dismantle it. But with so many stories floating around (and the many more that are silenced by fear) about “male feminists” who use their social justice rhetoric as a way to wield abusive behaviors, it’s clear that some of our quote-unquote “allies” are combining toxic masculinity with feminism to create a terrifying hybrid.
So, take it from us: Beware male feminists.
Because sometimes, under the cloak of feminism can lie a fearful reality.
1. Beware Male Feminists Who Seek to Control Your Sexuality
Beware men who learn words like liberation and body positive and sexual agency – and use them to guilt you into sex.
Beware men whose “I believe in women’s lib” really translates to “I believe women should have sexual agency, insofar as it benefits me.”
Beware men who support your right to have sex, but not your right not to have sex.
Beware men who don’t let you refuse, who demand of you more than “just vanilla,” who expect you (out of liberation) to take control.
Beware men who say “no means no,” but act like a lack of a no is the same thing as a yes – and then defend themselves with “You know I do anti-rape work” when they’re questioned about their own sexually violating behavior.
Beware men who say “no means no,” but tell you that women who “let down the cause” by taking control of their own bodies and sexual agency deserve what they get.
Beware men who say that they’re anti-rape, but think Beyoncé “shouldn’t dress like that” now that she’s a mother.
Beware men who watch porn, but degrade sex workers.
Beware men who distance themselves from men who perpetrate sexual and physical violence by insisting that “real men” don’t do those things.
Beware men who don’t make space for you to voice your desires and boundaries in bed – who are performing equality so strongly that they don’t practice justice; who expect you to speak up, but who never ask.
Your a/sexuality belongs to you.
2. Beware Male Feminists Who Believe They Have a Right to Your Appearance
Beware men who don’t like your red lipstick because it’s “not feminist,” but claim that sex with them will liberate you from patriarchy.
Beware men who question your use of mascara on your eyelashes or a razor on your legs, who tell you, “You don’t have to do that for me,” but ignore you when you say you aren’t.
Beware men who tell you that you look better without the makeup, the high heels, the short skirts you love – as though you do those things for them.
Beware men who drop hints about your “natural beauty” – ostensibly to free you from the binds of patriarchal oppression – and then suggest nude shades over bright ones.
Beware men who are “body positive” when thin people wear bikinis, but not when fat people do.
Beware men who tokenize their past partners to prove a point about being an “equal-opportunity, affirmative action” dater.
Beware men who believe their dating only white girls is a “preference,” but your not being attracted to them means you’re being unfair.
Beware men who ask, “Who are you getting all done up for?” – as if looking good for your own sake isn’t good enough.
Only you get to decide what you put on your body.
3. Beware Male Feminists Who Hide Their Abusive Tactics Behind a Gender-Equality Mask
Beware men who use the language of social justice to manipulate you.
Beware men who learn words like gaslighting so that they can accuse you of it when you disagree with them.
Beware men who wield their intersections of oppression as proof that they cannot be abusive toward you – because you hold more social power than they do.
Beware men who proclaim to support anti-violence work, but are violent in their own interactions.
Beware men who tell you “abuser dynamics” are when you lose your temper and can’t tell them why because you’re too hurt to think.
Beware men who financially exploit you, but then throw in your face that you make more money than they do.
Beware men who use words like bitch, slut, and cunt when angry in reference to you or other women.
Beware men who are aware that they have higher standing than you do in your feminist communities and (implicitly or explicitly) use that to control you.
Beware men who ask “Are you saying that I’m a bad feminist?” – as if that possibility is worse than the fact that they hurt you; as if that’s not a derailing tactic.
Beware men who learned about [insert feminist here] in Women’s Studies – and quote her during arguments to derail and silence you.
Beware men who pressure you to adopt behaviors and ideologies that suit them, under the guise that you need to radicalize.
If they’re wielding power and control over you, it’s abuse – no matter how prettily they disguise that.
4. Beware Male Feminists Who Set Up Womanhood As a Competition
Beware men who tell you you’re so much more clever, more mature than other girls, that they’ve never met a girl as enlightened as you.
Beware men who say they only sleep with smart girls, or liberal girls, or radical girls, as though those things are performances for them.
Beware men who treat you like a manic pixie dream girl who will whisk them away into a feminist wonderland.
Beware men who position themselves as arbiters of which women are “feminist enough” – and consider those who don’t meet the bar acceptable targets.
Beware men who divide you into the “good” ones and the “bad” ones – and play you against each other.
Beware men who divide you into “girls,” “women,” and “females,” depending on how they view the acceptability of your behavior.
Beware men who question the authenticity of other women’s feminism.
Beware men whose love and respect is contingent on your adherence to their idea of feminism, femaleness, femininity.
Womanhood is not a competition.
5. Beware Male Feminists Who Wield Masculine Objectivity As a Tool in Arguments
Beware men who value objectivity over subjectivity, especially the ones who consider themselves the final arbiters of what objectivity is.
Beware men who say they support women, but make you feel less intelligent for not being as “rational” as they are during arguments about your own rights.
Beware men who “play devil’s advocate” in conversations about your own lived experiences.
Beware men who think rational people should always separate the art from the artist, even when that artist is a violent predator.
Beware men who shoulder their way into feminist spaces so they can inject them with male “logic,” “reason,” and “rationality.”
Beware men who don’t own their biases.
Beware men whose first words when you relate your lived experience are “well, actually” or “not all.”
Beware men who ever call you “irrational” or “emotional” to silence you.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/trolling-translation/,10 Anti-Feminist Trolls You’ll Meet on the Internet – And What They’re Really Saying,"Originally published on Ravishly and republished here with their permission.
(Content Warning: Rape threats, abusive language)
Being a person with a presence on the Internet is…weird. It fills your life with a lot of, well, weirdness. Being a feminist with a presence on the Internet is even worse — besides the general weirdness, there’s also a lot of backlash. A lot of hate mail. And hate tweets. And hate Facebook messages and YouTube comments and (ugh) anonymous Tumblr asks.
What’s funny, though (I mean, if the blatant hatred of women with opinions can ever be funny, that is), is that trolls are not only predictable, but they’re transparent as all hell. They say the same stuff over and over again, and the true meanings of the words are incredibly thinly veiled.
So take it from me (I’m kind of an expert). Here’s what the trolls say — and here’s what they really mean:
1. You’re a Bitch/Slut/Cunt
I actually made an entire video on this a couple of years ago, and it’s the most popular thing I’ve ever uploaded to YouTube.
But the gist of the “You’re a bitch/slut/cunt” insult is this: “You’re a strong woman, and that intimidates me, so I’m going to try to make you feel bad for it,” “You’re a woman who’s having sex, but I don’t want women to have sex, even though I spend hours on any given Reddit thread complaining about how women won’t have sex with me, and I want to try to make you feel bad for it,” and “You’re a vagina.”
Oh. Umm.
Really, what they’re saying is, “You’re a woman! And so I’m going to call you any misogynistic slur I can think of because I don’t have a real argument against your point!”
2. Get Back in the Kitchen
This one has a very easy translation: “I literally have nothing more creative to say than this sentence that has been hurled at women for over fifty years. Take that, person with thoughts that I don’t agree with!”
3. Make Me a Sandwich
Sometimes this one and the previous come hand-in-hand. They belong together. Kind of like, while we’re on the subject of sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly.
This one means “I’ve frequently reflected on the fact that, throughout my life, women have nurtured me. Some have even gone so far as to feed me. Perhaps to the extent that I don’t know how to survive, really, without women. But instead of being grateful, like a decent human being, I’m going to imply that your only purpose on earth is to make lazy people like me sandwiches, thereby successfully undermining the work that women in my life put into helping me grow. Because I’m totally not an asshole.”
4. You Can’t Delete Your Comments – That’s Censorship!
I’m not even going to address the fact that, by its very definition, censorship can only happen at the governmental level – and that because I am but one person, I literally do not have the power to censor another person.
Instead, let’s address what’s really going on their head: “I honestly believe that I have a right to leave threatening and harassing bullshit all over your Facebook page without consequence. And I am furious that you would take that away from me.”
5. Typical Feminist – You Can’t Even Handle Debate
I think you probably need to take a foundational debating class if you think that calling me a “socialist whore” is a respectful and well-formed argument that would do me well to engage with in order to broaden my understanding of the world around me.
Translation: “I don’t have an argument. But maybe if I pretend that you’re the one without an argument, no one will notice that I have no idea what I’m talking about.”
6. Do You Think Men Should Be Able to Punch Women? That Women Should Be Drafted? That All Men Should Be Murdered?
Well, no. In case you missed the memo, I’m a feminist. That means I’m against stuff like, oh, intimate partner abuse, imperialism, and gender-based violence.",feminism
http://everydayfeminism.com/2017/09/feminists-single-payer-health-care/,Here’s What Feminists Need To Know About Single Payer Healthcare,"Right now, at least 11% of adults don’t have health insurance in the U.S — the 13th richest country in the world. A nation that doesn’t take care of its sick is one where every life clearly doesn’t matter.
There is a growing movement of folks who want to transform our capitalist healthcare system into one where everyone receives the same publicly-funded health insurance.
More Democrats than ever are advocating for single payer healthcare as a progressive alternative to President Trump’s failing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act — namely, by rolling back Medicaid expansion and providing massive tax cuts to the rich.
It’s no secret that the ins-and-outs of our healthcare system are overwhelming to navigate, and it can be hard to stay engaged in the national dialogue. So, we put together these key points to help break down what you need to know about single payer healthcare from an intersectional feminist perspective:
1. Single payer healthcare is funded by the government with taxpayer money but privately delivered in hospitals and doctor’s offices.
Under single payer, everyone is covered, regardless of age, gender, employment status, residency status or any other factor.
2. In countries with single payer, patients never see a bill.
They choose any doctor they want without worrying if their insurance will cover it. Doctors prescribe treatment to their patients without being concerned whether it’s covered.
While single payer is a new concept to many, it’s hardly a novel idea. Socialists, communists, worker organizations, and academics have been calling for a national health insurance program in the U.S. since the beginning of the 20th century.
Former President Harry Truman’s universal healthcare proposal in 1949 received pushback from both the American Medical Association and employer-based insurance companies that gained popularity after World War II.
However, the loudest opponents to single payer were whites, especially Southerners, who weren’t in favor of public entitlements that benefited Blacks. While Canada and several European countries passed single payer, the U.S. didn’t because of its deeply rooted racism.
3. Single payer doesn’t solve systemic oppression, but it does provide access to healthcare for the historically oppressed communities who need it most.
According to Stephanie Nakajima, Director of Communications at Healthcare-NOW, single payer has helped Canada almost eliminate racial gaps in unmet medical needs.
Single payer also ensures that each person has the ability to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. Currently, lacking adequate health insurance forces people to get unwanted abortions or to not have children even if they want them.
4. Abortion, contraception, and prenatal care would all be covered under single payer.
Furthermore, people wouldn’t have to pay higher insurance premiums or be denied coverage because of their ability to give birth.
As an intersectional feminist, I believe single payer aligns better with my values than our current profit-driven healthcare system. It would make accessing healthcare easier for Americans who hold multiple oppressed identities and have barriers to getting care.
I’ve never believed the hype about the U.S. having the best healthcare in the world because of the negative experiences I’ve had while navigating the system as a working-class Black genderqueer person.
There have been times I couldn’t go to the doctor or get medications because I didn’t have health insurance. Nobody should ever have to be in this situation, especially not in a country with so much wealth.
5. It doesn’t “cost too much money.”
Republicans say we can’t afford single payer. In reality, we can’t afford not to have universal healthcare. Nakajima says the U.S. spends 18 percent of our GDP on healthcare while most other “developed countries” spend only about 12 percent.
healthcare is bankrupting our economy, as well as bankrupting individuals who fall into medical debt, including people who have health insurance.
Most of us would pay less in taxes towards single payer than we currently pay to private insurance companies. 95 percent of Americans would pay less for their healthcare under single payer.",feminism
http://uproxx.com/music/toronto-venus-fest-feminist-music-community-lido-pimeienta/,How Toronto’s ‘Venus Fest’ Is Amplifying Feminist Music To Build Strong Community,"After Venus Fest founder Aerin Fogel told me that she’d only come up with the idea for a festival that exclusively books women and nonbinary performers this past April, walking into the Daniels Spectrum community hub for the inaugural event felt like a major victory. “My own personal desire to step forward in this role only started a few months ago,” she said. “But I think the need or desire for something like this has not just been mine, I’ve heard an expressed need for this from the community for a really long time.” Pulling it all together so quickly was really a testament to the idea itself — and the strength of the community Fogel had behind her.
To translate the all-day event into reality took a great deal of thought and work but when I showed up, it quickly became clear they’d thought of everything. Located in the redeveloped Regent Park neighborhood in Toronto’s east end, Daniels Spectrum’s is in a bit of a food desert, with not a lot of choices nearby, so various food vendors were brought in for the day. The building itself was chosen for its accessibility, and inside there were non-gendered bathrooms, a team of volunteers trained with naloxone kits, a “community card engagement” station where people could write down their info if they want to make fest friends, and so on. The whole thing seemed exhaustive, going above and beyond the usual of organization other large festivals undertake.
When I complimented her on how all-encompassing the festival was, Fogel laughed and said that was the goal. The entire experience ran smoothly from a spectator’s perspective, which is remarkable since it’s the first festival Fogel has ever thrown, but it also had to. As a living critique of the way most festivals have a structured gender imbalance in their lineups, there was a tremendous amount of pressure for Venus Fest’s argument to be airtight.
If something went wrong, if there weren’t enough attendees, if the sound wasn’t good or the lineup lagging, all of those issues become fodder for the majority of concert promoters who are disinterested in correcting the way that concert and festival lineups regularly skew male. Instead, throughout the day Venus Fest shone as a beacon of what could be.",feminism
http://dailydot.com/unclick/dove-real-beauty-body-bottles-memes/,Dove’s new body-type bottles are getting dunked on by feminist memes,"The marketing geniuses behind Dove’s “Real Women, Real Beauty” campaign have extended their theme of making all their customers feel beautiful to their packaging designs, dropping a series of body wash bottles in various shapes meant to represent diverse body types. As you might expect, “Real Beauty Bottles” is backfiring pretty hard.
The campaign is ostensibly meant to unify and support women, so dividing customers into a handful of body types isn’t exactly going over well:
@MissMandyHale @Dove That is bizarre. Like, I just want to my body wash, not be reminded that I'm pear shaped. Women don't need to be categorized all the time.
— Julie Daniel (@thejuliedaniel) May 8, 2017
@FastCompany @Dove So if CVS is out of ""skinny bitch"" bottles am I not going to be able to get clean? Not sure how this works.
— Jodi Beggs (@jodiecongirl) May 8, 2017
The only thing redeeming the campaign is the potential it creates for some very dank social criticism in the form of—what else?—memes on Twitter. Many of them are by women who feel irritated and patronized by Dove’s over-the-top marketing efforts. Some are by dudes who spotted an opportunity for comedy and jumped on the bandwagon because, well, dudes just can’t help themselves.

which dove bottle slash hercules cartoon muse are you!!! pic.twitter.com/FwSWzoGzuR
One overarching theme of these gags is that normalizing seven body types isn’t that much better than normalizing one. What if you’re more of an Edward Scissorhands or a Mrs. Butterworth? Does Dove not want your business? Yes, these are funny jokes, but there’s truth to them: In an attempt to embrace all customers, the company has made many feel dehumanized.
Much like “real beauty comes in all shapes and sizes,” so does the criticism of Dove. Some women haven’t forgiven the company for the condescension of its previous campaigns:
Unless they're made of the flesh and bones of the women who failed to surrender to the demands to smile more of the last Dove campaign, pass https://t.co/RqblaJ6S6g
Others point out that, in our fun, corporatist society, there’s basically no means of consumption that benefits women anyway, so please stop trying to co-opt feminism for capitalist gain:

http://elitedaily.com/p/new-rules-songwriter-emily-warren-on-how-she-wrote-2017s-feminist-anthem-exclusive-7599418,"""New Rules"" Songwriter Emily Warren On How She Wrote 2017's Feminist Anthem — EXCLUSIVE","""One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone."" It's impossible to read those lines from Dua Lipa's ""New Rules"" without immediately singing them in your head. Since its release earlier this summer, ""New Rules"" has become one of 2017's biggest hits. Beyond its success on the charts and on streaming services, it has become a feminist anthem thanks to its message of empowerment and its amplification of the importance of female friendships. ""New Rules"" songwriter Emily Warren spoke with Elite Daily about the creation of the song and how it has helped carve out an inclusive space for exclusively female experiences in the music industry (and how she felt when it was turned into a meme when Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber got back together). Just as 2017 gave women films like Lady Bird, Wonder Woman, and Girls Trip — stories for and by women — Emily Warren and Dua Lipa have delivered that same inclusivity for the music industry with ""New Rules."" It's the kind of art that makes you think, ""How did they write exactly what I'm thinking?!"" So what goes behind the creation of such an anthem? Was ""New Rules"" a surprise success for Warren and Dua Lipa?
Warren tells Elite Daily that you never expect a song to be successful, but when she was writing ""New Rules"" with her friend Caroline, they realized they had something good. She says that as a songwriter, you can be aware that what you've written is good (at least from your own perspective) and could be even better given the right platform, but there's no tangible way of knowing you've written one of the most popular songs of the year. She says, ""With 'New Rules,' what is so exciting about the fact that it’s doing well is I’ve been encouraged, when I first got to L.A., not to write songs where the guy 'wasn’t gonna get it.'"" *The entire female race sighs an all-knowing sigh*. Yeah, that tracks.
She continues, ""So writing songs like 'New Rules,' we were just taking a risk ‘cause it was something that was actually going on with Caroline."" First of all, love hearing that ""New Rules"" was inspired by real events, although I would love it just as much if it wasn't because it's still relatable as hell.
Warren tells Elite Daily that while the hard part of songwriting is letting go of control of the song once an artist picks it up, she thinks Dua Lipa nailed it, especially with the music video (which has garnered a sh*t ton of praise on its own). She says, ""I think it was super bold of Dua’s team to pick it and her to actually put it out and everything just ‘cause it’s a pretty uncommon sentiment, but it ended up being super timely and relevant and just an important message, which is so awesome.""
Warren, who has been on tour with The Chainsmokers all year, won a Grammy for writing their single ""Don't Let Me Down,"" and wrote some of the songs off Shawn Mendes' album Handwritten, tells Elite Daily she had the current straight-up awful state of the world in mind when she wrote ""New Rules."" She knew there was a hole that needed filling, and that hole was a song for women and no one else. No story of a guy ""getting it"" or even having a say in the matter. It's a breakup song encouraging women to stay strong in their convictions and lean on their girlfriends for support during moments of weakness. It's universal in the sense that it's so personal, and in terms of its feminist quality, Warren says that when she wrote the song with her friend, she had been trying to write the ""right thing"" for a while.
Dua Lipa on YouTube
""I talk about [writing explicitly feminist songs] a lot,"" she says. ""I think about it more in a way of trying not to do the wrong thing, but I haven’t yet really written the right thing in terms of actually addressing this type of issue, so that was definitely in the back of my mind [when writing ""New Rules.""]"" She tells Elite Daily ""New Rules"" was one of her first attempts at doing the ""right thing,"" aka writing a song about an experience that's unapologetically female. She continues,
Warren tells Elite Daily that ""New Rules"" proves listeners can handle more nuanced, thought-provoking lyrics and even prefer them in this day and age. She says, ""Something ‘New Rules’ taught me is people are so much smarter than we give them credit for."" She continues, ""That song has a lot of words in it. It’s packed with information, people can totally handle it, and people are singing along. So, as writers, I think we should all be pushing ourselves to actually talk about things in music because the world is so f*cked up right now and to not address it is kind of crazy."" In this same vein, she's hyperaware of her responsibility to create music that isn't demeaning toward women. ""I’m really hesitant to write super sexualized songs unless it’s something that I’ve actually felt,"" she says. ""And I just feel like ‘New Rules’ is just a cool example of that because we were not thinking about, ‘OK, what’s going to work?’ or ‘Is the label going to take it?’ It was just a true story that Caroline had gone through, so it made it easy to write about that.""
Warren adds some of the successful music she hears that sexualizes women shocks her. She tells Elite Daily, ""I’m sometimes startled by some of the songs that I hear playing on the radio that are just horrible things to be singing along to that are just offensive and demeaning stuff, and I think I always try in my writing to make sure that I don’t forget about that."" She adds,
""New Rules"" has been named the best song of 2017 by TIME, with Rolling Stone and The New York Times both listing it in its lists of the year's best songs. Warren was also just listed on Forbes' 30 Under 30 In Music list, and the song is the first solo female number 1 single in the U.K. since Adele's “Hello,"" so safe to say there was plenty of space for a song like this to exist. All of this ""mind-blowing"" success aside, Warren says she didn't consider the song would become some of the background music of the #MeToo movement/this moment in history where women are refusing to stay silent about their truths any longer. She tells Elite Daily, ""It’s awesome to have written a song where people are actually discussing the lyrics and discussing the message because I think I’ve had things that’ve done well and things that’ve done slightly well that are just good 'catch' pop songs and with not that much of a story behind them."" She continues,
A not as profound but still amazing reaction to ""New Rules"" was the fact it that was used as a meme when Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber got back together earlier this fall. People were tweeting the song's lyrics at Gomez in an attempt to basically say, ""Girl, are you sure about this?!"" The ""New Rules"" memes about Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber made it onto Warren's radar, and she wants you to know she loves them all.
When asked how she feels about them, she laughs and says, ""You can’t really plan for anything like that, so it’s a really good outcome. But it’s just awesome. You tend to not chase kind of 'trendy' things, and then when it just works out that way, it’s just the best possible thing that can happen.""
Now, Warren has her first solo album coming out in 2018. Although there's no set release date yet, her team says you can probably expect to see it in the springtime. She realized she needed to start making her own music once she had a collection of songs she intended to sell, but couldn't bring herself to do it. She tells Elite Daily, ""A lot of the songs that I’m going to be putting out on my album are songs that I’ve written originally for pitch, and then it didn’t matter if someone wanted to take them, I always felt uncomfortable about it. That’s when I realized I need to start doing my own music because I have something I want to say."" She says her favorite songwriter of all time is John Mayer, and artists like John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Emeli Sandé, and Ryan Tedder are some of her other favorites. The one thing they all have in common is the storytelling in their music — the most important part of any song, in her opinion. ""I listen to a lot of music from the ‘60s and the early jazz days because I love storytelling in songs,"" she says. ""I think the way that [John Mayer] tells a story and the how the melody always goes with what he’s saying, like with the emotion of what he’s saying, is something that I’m always thinking about in writing.""
On her so far unnamed album, you can expect every song to tell a story that has personally happened to her. All of the singles she's released on her own thus far have done just that, and she's looking forward to releasing more music that takes what seems to be a sad song and making it upbeat in its melody — one of her favorite current trends in music. She says,
The success of ""New Rules"" taught Warren that people are ready and aching to hear music that is apologetically about the female experience. Women have been ready for this ""no more beating around the bush"" music, and Warren's ready to provide.",feminism
